# Preface

Prior to the spring of my third year of medical school, I hadn't heard of the specialty emergency medicine.  I  didn't  know  where  in  the  medical  center  our  'emergency room' (ER) 1  was and I didn't know that we had a combined emergency medicine (EM)/internal  medicine  (IM)  residency  program. Apparently,  they  didn't  promote the  program  much among the medical students. One day, shortly before I was to begin my final year of medical school, an EM/IM resident enlightened me and convinced me to squeeze an EM elective into my upcoming schedule. Fast forward a few months, I began my EM rotation and was hooked. On September 21,1979, three weeks into my EM elective, emergency medicine (EM) was recognized as the 23rd American specialty. Yes, I'm that old and so is our specialty.

I  prepared for my initial EM certification board exams using the first edition of The Study Guide . It was well written, easy to read, and much shorter than the current eighth edition of Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine Manual , which is derived from the eighth edition of Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide . What a great honor it has been to work with Dr. Tintinalli and to contribute to both her namesake textbook and manual.

While a single editor compiled Tintinalli's first Study Guide ,  the eighth edition of Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine Manual includes contributors from across the globe, including several African nations where emergency medicine is an emerging  specialty.  The  eighth  edition  includes  'Palliative  Care,'  which  was  certainly not  on  emergency  medicine's  radar  in  1979,  but  is  now  recognized  as  a  subspecialty of our discipline. We continue to publish the Manual in multiple languages for our readers around the world and hope that the Manual and its online version at accessemergencymedicine.mhmedical.com continues to serve the daily needs of medical students, residents, advanced practice providers, and practicing emergency physicians.

The co-editors Michael T. Fitch, Scott Joing, Vincent Wang, David M. Cline, O. John Ma, and I would like to thank all the authors for their excellent efforts in writing and updating chapters while also maintaining busy clinical schedules. Thanks, too, to the hardworking crew at McGraw Hill Education for their guidance in taking this project from draft to publication: Brian Belval, Christie Naglieri, Jessica Gonzalez, Juanita Thompson, and Poonam Bisht. Finally, I am grateful to have had such wonderful team of editors with whom to work. They made publishing this handbook a delight. Thanks Michael, Scott, Vincent, David, and John.

RKC dedicates this book to Marc, Matthew, Lissy, and Noah, as well as to emergency care providers around the world; MF dedicates this book to Missy, Mira, and Maya, and in memory of Dr. John Marx; SJ dedicates this book to wonderful Elizabeth, Micah, Owen, Britta, and Emmy along with the outstanding Hennepin County Medical Center EM faculty and residents; VW dedicates this book to Esther, Elijah, and Evaline; DMC dedicates this book to family: home, church, and professional; OJM dedicates this book to everyone dedicated to advancing quality of care and patient safety in emergency medicine.

# Resuscitation Techniques

1

Airway assessment and management is one of the most critical interventions that emergency physicians perform. Intubation is not always necessary, however, and rushing into invasive airway management before initial resuscitation can be problematic.

# ■ RAPID AIRWAY ASSESSMENT

Perform  a  rapid  clinical  airway  assessment  which  includes  noting  the patient's level of responsiveness, skin color, respiratory rate, and depth of respirations. Obtain oxygen saturation and capnography unless the patient is  in  impending  or  actual  cardiac  arrest.  The  goal  is  to  determine  if  the patient is maintaining and protecting their airway and meeting critical oxygenation and ventilation goals. Nothing should be placed in the pharynx to assess gag reflex. Emergent and immediate decisions on airway management may proceed before obtaining blood gases and x-rays.

# ■ IMPENDING/ACTUAL CARDIAC ARREST

Open the airway and initiate low-volume ventilation unless following cardiocerebral resuscitation protocols. The primary focus of initial cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  is  on  establishing  quality  chest  compressions  and evaluating for a shockable rhythm. Once these priorities are addressed, the airway can be further managed with an extraglottic device or endotracheal intubation.

# ■ BASIC AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

Position the patient to open the airway, drain secretions and maximize oxygenation and ventilation, while maintaining cervical stabilization precautions if indicated.  Place  conscious  patients  in  a  sitting  position,  if  possible,  and unconscious patients on their side unless they require urgent invasive procedures. Patients who are unable to maintain an open airway should have one or two properly sized nasal trumpets placed if they are not anticoagulated or at risk for mid-face fractures; an oral airway may be used instead of, or in

addition to, the nasal airways if no gag reflex present. Provide supplemental oxygen if the room air saturation is below 94% with the goal of increasing saturation to above 94%; high flow oxygen should be avoided when possible.

# ■ NONINVASIVE POSITIVE PRESSURE VENTILATION

If ventilation is adequate but oxygenation is poor, consider immediate initiation of noninvasive ventilation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be used as a temporizing measure while other treatments are initiated  (e.g.,  nitrates  in  acute  cardiogenic  pulmonary  edema),  for  preoxygenation prior to intubation in any medical condition, or as an alternative to invasive airway management in some cases, such as in patients with DNR or DNI status. NIPPV for emergency situations is commonly delivered via a full-face mask using either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)  or  bilevel  positive  airway  pressure  (BPAP)  using  a  ventilator, stand-alone  reusable  device,  or  a  disposable  device  (CPAP  only).  CPAP provides  the  same  amount  of  pressure  support  during  inspiration  and positive  end-expiratory  pressure  (PEEP)  during  exhalation-usually  5  to 10  mmHg-while  BPAP  allows  for  increasing  pressure  support  up  to 15 mm Hg without overwhelming the patient with expiratory resistance, which  may  remain  at  5  to  10  mm  Hg.  There  are  no  studies  showing  a significant advantage to one system over another.

# ■ MASK VENTILATION

Begin  mask  ventilation  for  patients  with  poor  respiratory  effort.  Patients should be placed in a sniffing or ramped position with airway adjuncts as previously discussed. Apply a properly fitted mask with one provider dedicated  to  maintaining  a  tight  seal  while  a  second  provider  or  mechanical ventilator provides just enough volume to raise the chest. Two different hand grips are described to achieve a mask seal during two-person mask ventilation with the 'T-E' preferred over the 'E-C' in most cases (Fig. 1-1). If you are unable to achieve a tight mask seal consider placing an extraglottic device if there is no gag reflex or other contraindication. If good chest rise is noted but saturations remain poor despite supplemental oxygen, add PEEP.

# ■ EXTRAGLOTTIC DEVICES

Extraglottic devices (EGDs) are placed blindly and fit into the following category: (1) supraglottic devices that include a mask that sits internally over  the  glottic  opening  or  (2)  retroglottic,  dual-balloon  devices  that  sit within the proximal esophagus and include distal and proximal balloons to direct the ventilation that occurs through holes between the two balloons into  the  airway.  Supraglottic  devices  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the Ambu Auragain ® , LMA Supreme ® , LMA Protector ® , LMA Fastrach, Intersurgical iGel ® , and CookGas AirQ. Retroglottic devices include the Esophageal-Tracheal Combitube, the Rusch EasyTube, and the King Laryngeal Tube ® . Many of these devices now include a channel for gastric decompression (theoretically lessens the risk of aspiration) and some facilitate blind or endoscopic intubation.

Extraglottic devices are most commonly used in the ED after a failed airway but  may  also  be  used  primarily  during  cardiac  arrest,  for  difficult  mask

ventilation or as part of rapid sequence airway procedures. It is critical to always have an appropriately sized EGD available during airway management to place the device in case difficulties are encountered but do not rely on an EGD to the exclusion of surgical airway when critical hypoxemia is encountered.

4 SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

# ■ INTUBATION

Intubate patients in cardiac arrest after other critical resuscitation steps have been assured. Intubation is indicated for unconscious, nonarrested patients unless a rapidly correctable situation is suspected, such as an opioid overdose or simple postictal state. Consider intubation for conscious patients with  refractory  hypoxemia  or  a  deteriorating  clinical  course.  Rapid sequence  intubation  (RSI)  technique  should  be  used  unless  the  patient's condition makes it unnecessary (i.e., cardiac arrest) or when it is contraindicated because of an anticipated difficult airway. RSI includes the simultaneous administration of an induction agent and a neuromuscular blocking agent  to  facilitate  orotracheal  intubation  in  the  nonarrested/peri-arrested patient. Anticipated difficulty in mask ventilation, intubation, rescue with an extraglottic device and surgical airway placement are relative contraindications to RSI; awake techniques should be considered in these circumstances.  Current  evidence  suggests  that  multiple  intubation  attempts  are associated with adverse events. Thus, all efforts should be made to set up success on the first intubation attempt.

# ■ OROTRAChEAL INTUBATION

modification to the operator, laryngoscope and blade selection, patient positioning, use of bougie, etc. If unable to maintain saturations with mask ventilation, insert an EGD while preparing for a possible surgical airway.  If  saturations  are  maintained  but  intubation  is  unsuccessful within three attempts, or deemed unlikely to be successful at any point, place an EGD.

# Surgical Airway

A surgical  airway  is  performed  either  when  intubation  via  the  mouth  or nose is not considered a reasonable clinical option or when intubation has failed and critical oxygen saturation cannot be maintained via other means.

SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

A surgical airway is contraindicated in children younger than 10 years of age  in  whom  transtracheal  jet  ventilation  is  the  preferred  subglottic technique. Although several surgical techniques have been described, the bougie-aided  technique  is  described  here.  There  are  kits  available  for Seldinger-based  and  other  'less  invasive'  techniques  but  these  are  not reviewed here.

# ■ NONTACHYCARDIC IRREGULAR DYSRHYTHMIAS

# Sinus Arrhythmia

Some variation in the sinoatrial (SA) node discharge rate is common; however,  if  the  variation  exceeds  120  milliseconds  between  the  longest  and shortest  intervals,  sinus  arrhythmia  is  present.  The  electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of sinus arrhythmia are ( a ) normal sinus P waves and PR intervals, ( b ) 1:1 atrioventricular (A V) conduction, and ( c ) variation of at  least  120  milliseconds  between  the  shortest  and  longest  P-P  interval (Fig. 2-1). If two or more different P wave morphologies are present, atrial ectopy, wandering atrial pacemaker, or another competing nonsinus focus may be present. Sinus arrhythmias are affected primarily by respiration and are most commonly found in children and young adults, disappearing with advancing age. Occasional junctional escape beats may be present during very long P-P intervals. No treatment is required.

# Premature Atrial Contractions

Premature atrial contractions (PACs) have the following ECG characteristics:  ( a )  the  ectopic  P  wave  appears  sooner  (premature)  than  the  next expected sinus beat; ( b ) the ectopic P wave has a different shape and direction; and ( c ) the ectopic P wave may or may not be conducted through the AV node (Fig. 2-2). Most PACs are conducted with typical QRS complexes, but  some  may  be  conducted  aberrantly  through  the  infranodal  system, typically with a right bundle branch block pattern. When the PAC occurs during the absolute refractory period, it is not conducted. Since the sinus node is often depolarized and reset, the interval between normal P waves before and after the PAC will not be twice the existing P to P interval, creating a shorter pause than a fully compensatory pause (unlike that seen after most premature ventricular contractions). PACs are associated with stress, fatigue, alcohol use, tobacco, coffee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), digoxin toxicity, and coronary artery disease, and may occur after adenosine-converted  paroxysmal  supraventricular  tachycardia  (PSVT). Patients  may  complain  of  palpitations  or  an  intermittent  'sinking'  or 'fluttering' feeling in the chest. PACs are common in all ages, often in the

absence  of  significant  heart  disease,  but  can  precipitate  sustained  atrial tachycardia, flutter, or fibrillation under certain circumstances.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Premature Ventricular Contractions

# Clinical Features

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are due to impulses originating from single or multiple areas in the ventricles. The ECG characteristics of PVCs are as follows: ( a ) a premature and wide QRS complex; ( b ) no preceding P wave; ( c )  the  ST  segment and T wave of the PVC are directed opposite the preceding major QRS deflection; ( d ) most PVCs do not affect the sinus node, so there is usually a fully compensatory postectopic pause, or the PVC may be interpolated between two sinus beats; ( e ) many PVCs have a fixed coupling interval (within 40 milliseconds) from the preceding sinus beat; and ( f ) many PVCs are conducted into the atria, thus producing a  retrograde  P  wave  (Fig.  2-3).  If  three  or  more  PVCs  occur  in  a  row, patients are considered to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

PVCs are very common, occurring in most patients with ischemic heart disease  and  acute  myocardial  infarction  (MI).  Other  common  causes  of PVCs include digoxin toxicity, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypokalemia,  alkalosis,  hypoxia,  and  sympathomimetic  drugs.  Pooled  data  and meta-analyses  have  found  no  reduction  in  mortality  from  suppressive  or prophylactic treatment of PVCs. Ventricular parasystole occurs when the ectopic ventricular focus fires frequently enough to compete with the SA node and is associated with cardiac ischemia, electrolyte imbalance, and hypertensive or ischemic heart disease.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ BRADYDYSRHYTHMIAS

# Sinus Bradycardia

# Clinical Features

Sinus  bradycardia  occurs  when  the  SA  node  rate  becomes  slower  than 60 beats/min. The ECG characteristics of sinus bradycardia are ( a ) normal sinus P waves and PR intervals, ( b ) 1:1 AV conduction, and ( c ) atrial rate slower than 60 beats/min. Sinus bradycardia represents a suppression of the sinus node discharge rate, usually in response to three categories of stimuli: ( a ) physiologic (vagal tone), ( b ) pharmacologic (calcium channel blockers, β -blockers,  or  digoxin),  and  ( c )  pathologic  (acute  inferior  myocardial infarction (MI), increased intracranial pressure, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism, or sick sinus syndrome).

--- Page 33 ---

CHAPTER 2: Management of Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances

13

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Sinus  bradycardia  usually  does  not  require  specific  treatment  unless  the heart rate is slower than 50 beats/min and there is evidence of hypoperfusion.

# Junctional Rhythms

# Clinical Features

In patients with sinus bradycardia, SA node exit block, or A V block, junctional escape beats may occur, usually at a rate between 40 and 60 beats/ min, depending on the level of the rescue pacemaker within the conduction system. Junctional escape beats may conduct retrogradely into the atria, but the  QRS  complex  usually  will  mask  any  retrograde  P  wave  (Fig.  2-4). When alternating rhythmically with the SA node, junctional escape beats

--- Page 34 ---

14

SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

may cause bigeminal or trigeminal rhythms. Sustained junctional escape rhythms may be seen with CHF, myocarditis, acute MI (especially inferior MI), hyperkalemia, or digoxin toxicity ('regularized Afib'). If the ventricular rate is too slow, myocardial or cerebral ischemia may develop. In cases of enhanced junctional automaticity, junctional rhythms may be accelerated (60 to 100 beats/min) or tachycardic ( ≥ 100 beats/min), thus overriding the SA node rate.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# idioventricular Rhythm

# Clinical Features

The ECG characteristics of  idioventricular  rhythm  (IVR)  are  ( a )  wide and regular QRS complexes; ( b )  a  rate  between 40 and 100 beats/min, often close to the preceding sinus rate; ( c ) mostly runs of short duration (3 to 30 beats/min); and ( d ) an AIVR often beginning with a fusion beat (Fig. 2-5). This condition is found most commonly with an acute MI or in the setting of reperfusion after successful thrombolysis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is not necessary unless the patient is unstable or pulseless. On occasion,  especially  after  reperfusion  therapy,  the  IVR  may  be  the  only functioning pacemaker, and suppression with lidocaine can lead to cardiac asystole.

If the patient is hypotensive or in arrest, treatment includes identifying contributing mechanical factors (e.g., aggressive volume resuscitation) and α -adrenergic agents.

--- Page 35 ---

CHAPTER 2: Management of Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances

15

# Sick Sinus Syndrome

# Clinical Features

Otherwise known as tachy-brady syndrome, sick sinus syndrome consists of a variety of abnormalities in impulse generation and conduction, leading to various supraventricular tachycardic rhythms as well as bradycardia due to sinus arrest and SA block. It can be seen in myocardial ischemia, myocarditis,  rheumatologic  disease,  cardiomyopathies,  or  metastatic  disease. Conditions that increase vagal tone such acute abdominal pain, thyrotoxicosis, and hypo- or hyperkalemia exacerbate this condition.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment should be based on the presenting rhythm depending on the heart rate and patient instability. Temporary pacing may be needed and admission for permanent pacemaker placement is frequently indicated.

# ■ ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCKS

# First-Degree Atrioventricular (AV) Block

First-degree AV block is characterized by a delay in A V conduction, manifested by a prolonged PR interval ( > 200 milliseconds). It can be found in normal hearts and in association with increased vagal tone, digoxin toxicity, inferior  MI,  amyloid,  and  myocarditis.  First-degree  A V  block  needs  no treatment.  Second-degree  AV  block  is  characterized  by  intermittent  A V nodal conduction: some atrial impulses reach the ventricles, whereas others are blocked, thereby causing 'grouped beating.' These blocks can be subdivided  into  nodal  blocks  which  are  typically  reversible  and  infranodal blocks  which  are  due  to  irreversible  conduction  system  disease.  Thirddegree AV block is characterized by complete interruption in AV conduction with resulting A V dissociation.

# Second-Degree Mobitz i (Wenckebach) AV Block

# Clinical Features

Mobitz I AV block is a nodal block causing a progressive prolongation of conduction  through  the  A V  node  until  the  atrial  impulse  is  completely blocked. Usually, only one atrial impulse is blocked at a time. After the dropped beat, the AV conduction returns to normal and the cycle usually repeats  itself  with  the  same  conduction  ratio  (fixed  ratio)  or  a  different conduction ratio (variable ratio). Although the PR intervals progressively lengthen before the dropped beat, the increments by which they lengthen decrease with  successive  beats  causing  a  progressive shortening of  each successive R-R interval before the dropped beat (Fig. 2-6). This block is

--- Page 36 ---

16

SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

often transient and usually associated with an acute inferior MI, digoxin toxicity, or myocarditis or can be seen after cardiac surgery. Because the blockade occurs at the level of the A V node itself rather than at the infranodal conducting system, this is usually a stable rhythm.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Second-Degree Mobitz ii AV Block

# Clinical Features

Mobitz II A V block is typically due to infranodal disease, causing a constant PR interval with intermittent nonconducted atrial beats (Fig. 2-7). One or more beats may be nonconducted at a single time. This block indicates significant damage or dysfunction  of  the  infranodal  conduction  system;  therefore,  the QRS complexes are usually wide coming from the low His-Purkinje bundle or the ventricles. Type II blocks are more dangerous than type I blocks because they  are  usually  permanent  and  may  progress  suddenly  to  complete  heart block, especially in the setting of an acute anterior MI, and almost always require  permanent  cardiac  pacemaker  placement.  When  second-degree A V block occurs with a fixed conduction ratio of 2:1, it is not possible to differentiate between a Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz type II block.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

--- Page 37 ---

CHAPTER 2: Management of Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances

17

may be ineffective. All patients should have transcutaneous pacing pads positioned  and  ready  for  use  in  the  case  of  further  deterioration  into complete heart block.

# Third-Degree (Complete) AV Block

# Clinical Features

In  third-degree A V  block,  there  is  no A V  conduction.  The  ventricles  are paced by an escape pacemaker from the AV node or the infranodal conduction system at a rate slower than the atrial rate (Fig. 2-8). When third-degree AV block occurs at the AV node, a junctional escape pacemaker takes over with  a  ventricular  rate  of  40  to  60  beats/min,  and  because  the  rhythm originates  from  above  the  bifurcation  of  the  His  bundle,  the  QRS  complexes are narrow. Nodal third-degree AV block may develop in up to 8% of  acute  inferior  MIs  and  it  is  usually  transient,  although  it  may  last  for several days.

When third-degree AV block occurs at the infranodal level, the ventricles are driven by a ventricular escape rhythm at a rate slower than 40 beats/ min. Third-degree AV block located in the bundle branch or the Purkinje system invariably has an escape rhythm with a wide QRS complex. Like Mobitz  type  II  block,  this  indicates  structural  damage  to  the  infranodal conduction system and can be seen in acute anterior MIs. The ventricular escape pacemaker is usually inadequate to maintain cardiac output and is unstable with periods of ventricular asystole.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ FASCICULAR BLOCKS

Conduction blocks may arise in one or more of the three infranodal conduction pathways. Blockage of either of the left fascicles does not prolong the QRS duration, but will change the QRS axis. Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) causes left axis deviation with qR complex seen in aVR, while the

--- Page 38 ---

18

SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

much less common left posterior fascicular block (LPFB) causes right axis deviation. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) will prolong the QRS duration ( > 120 milliseconds) and cause an RSR', or "rabbit ears," in the early precordial leads (V1-2). Bifascicular block denotes a combination of any two of these fascicles, the most notable of which is left bundle branch block (LAFB + LPFB). Trifascicular block denotes the presence of first degree AV block in the presence of a bifascicular block and is indicative of significant conduction system disease that includes the A V node, thus increasing the risk of Mobitz II or third-degree A V block and the potential need for permanent pacemaker placement.

# ■ NARROW COMpLEX TACHYCARDIAS

# Sinus Tachycardia

# Clinical Features

The ECG characteristics of sinus tachycardia are ( a ) normal sinus P waves and PR intervals and ( b ) an atrial rate usually between 100 and 160 beats/ min. Sinus tachycardia is in response to one of three categories of stimuli: ( a ) physiologic (pain or exertion), ( b ) pharmacologic (sympathomimetics, caffeine,  or  bronchodilators),  or  ( c )  pathologic  (fever,  hypoxia,  anemia, hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism, or hyperthyroidism). In many of these conditions, the increased heart rate is an effort to increase cardiac output to match increased circulatory needs.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Since sinus tachycardia is a compensatory rhythm, the focus should be on diagnosing and treating the underlying condition.

# Atrial Flutter

# Clinical Features

Atrial flutter is a rhythm that originates from a small area within the atria. ECG characteristics of atrial flutter are ( a ) a regular atrial rate between 250 and 350 beats/min; ( b )  'saw tooth' flutter waves directed superiorly and most visible in leads II, III, and aV F ;  and  ( c ) AV block, usually 2:1, but occasionally  greater  or  irregular  (Fig.  2-9).  One-to-one  conduction  may occur if a bypass tract is present. Carotid sinus massage or Valsalva maneuvers are useful techniques to slow the ventricular response by increasing the degree of AV block, which can unmask flutter waves in uncertain cases.

--- Page 39 ---

CHAPTER 2: Management of Cardiac Rhythm Disturbances

19

Atrial flutter is seen most commonly in patients with ischemic heart disease as  well  as  CHF,  acute  MI,  pulmonary  embolus,  myocarditis,  blunt  chest trauma, and digoxin toxicity. Atrial flutter may be a transitional arrhythmia between sinus  rhythm  and  atrial  fibrillation.  Consider  anticoagulation  in patients  with  an  unclear  time  of  onset  or  duration  longer  than  48  hours before conversion to sinus rhythm due to increased risk of atrial thrombus and embolization.

# Emergency Department Care

The treatment is the same as atrial fibrillation and is discussed below.

# Atrial Fibrillation

# Clinical Features

Atrial  fibrillation  (Afib)  occurs  when  there  are  multiple,  small  areas  of atrial myocardium continuously discharging in a disorganized fashion. This results in loss of effective atrial contraction and decreases left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which may precipitate CHF in patients with impaired cardiac function. The ECG characteristics of Afib are ( a ) fibrillatory waves of atrial activity, best seen in leads V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , and aV F ; and ( b ) an irregular ventricular  response,  usually  between  170  and  180  beats/min  in  patients with a healthy AV node (Fig. 2-10).

Afib may be paroxysmal (lasting for less than 7 days), persistent (lasting for more than 7 days), or chronic (continuous). Afib can be idiopathic (lone Afib) or may be found in association with longstanding hypertension, ischemic heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, alcohol use ('holiday heart'), COPD, and thyrotoxicosis. Patients with LV dysfunction who depend on atrial contraction may suffer acute CHF with Afib onset. Rates of greater than 300 beats/min with a wide QRS complex are concerning for a preexcitation syndrome such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) (Fig. 2-11).

Patients  with Afib  who  are  not  anticoagulated  have  a  yearly  embolic event rate as high as 5% and a lifetime risk greater than 25%. Conversion from atrial fibrillation of 12 hours duration or less to sinus rhythm carries a 0.3% risk of arterial embolism compared to a risk of 1% for durations of 12 to 48 hours. Patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus are particularly  at  risk  with  embolic  rates  as  high  as  9.8%.  Anticoagulation  for 3 weeks is required before cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation for longer than 48 hours duration and in those patients with an uncertain time of onset who are not on anticoagulation therapy.

# Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia

# Clinical Features

Multifocal  atrial  tachycardia  (MAT)  is  defined  as  at  least  three  different sites of atrial ectopy. The ECG characteristics of MAT are ( a ) three or more differently shaped P waves; ( b ) changing PP, PR, and RR intervals; and ( c ) atrial rhythm usually between 100 and 180 beats/min (Fig. 2-12). Because the rhythm is irregularly irregular, MAT can be confused with atrial flutter or  atrial  fibrillation  (AFib).  MAT  is  found  most  often  in  elderly  patients with decompensated COPD, but it also may be found in patients with CHF, sepsis, methylxanthine toxicity, or digoxin toxicity.

# Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia

# Clinical Features

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a regular, rapid rhythm that arises from impulse reentry or an ectopic pacemaker above the bifurcation of the His bundle. The reentrant variety is the most common (Fig. 2-13). Patients often present with acute, symptomatic episodes termed paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (A VnRT) can occur in a normal heart or in association with rheumatic heart disease, acute pericarditis, MI, mitral valve prolapse, or preexcitation syndromes. In patients  with  atrioventricular  bypass  tracts  (A VRT),  reentry  can  occur  in either  direction,  usually  (80%  to  90%  of  patients)  in  a  direction  that  goes down the AV node and up the bypass tract producing a narrow QRS complex (orthodromic conduction). In the remaining 10% to 20% of patients, reentry occurs in the reverse direction (antidromic conduction). Ectopic SVT usually originates in the atria, with an atrial rate of 100 to 250 beats/min and may be seen  in  patients  with  acute  MI,  chronic  lung  disease,  pneumonia,  alcohol intoxication, or digoxin toxicity. There is a high incidence of tachyarrhythmias  in  patients  with  preexcitation  syndromes  including  PSVT  (40%  to 80%), atrial fibrillation (10% to 20%), and atrial flutter (about 5%).

(VT;  see Ventricular  Tachycardia)  unless  there  is  a  known  history  of WPW syndrome. Patients with this type of tachycardia are at risk for rapid ventricular rates and degeneration into VF; therefore, agents that preferentially block the A V node such as β -blockers, calcium channel blockers,  and  digoxin  should  not  be  used.  Treat  stable  patients  with procainamide , 15 to 17 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes up to 50 mg/kg, or until  50%  QRS  widening  is  noted  (contraindicated  in  patients  with myasthenia gravis since it may increase weakness).

# ■ WIDE COMpLEX TACHYCARDIAS

# Ventricular Tachycardia

# Clinical Features

VT is the occurrence of three or more successive beats from a ventricular ectopic pacemaker at a rate faster than 100 beats/min. The ECG characteristics of VT are ( a ) a wide QRS complex, ( b ) a rate faster than 100 beats/ min  (most  commonly  150  to  200  beats/min),  ( c )  a  regular  rhythm, although there may be some initial beat-to-beat variation, and ( d ) a constant QRS axis (Fig. 2-14). The most common causes of VT are ischemic heart disease and acute MI, accounting for approximately 50% of all cases of symptomatic VT.

Other etiologies include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse,  drug  toxicity  (digoxin,  antiarrhythmics,  or  sympathomimetics), hypoxia,  hypokalemia,  and  hyperkalemia.  In  general,  all  wide  complex tachycardia should be treated as VT regardless of clinical symptoms or initial vital signs. Adenosine appears to cause little harm in patients with VT; therefore, stable patients with wide complex tachycardia due to suspected SVT with aberrancy (see previous section) may be treated safely with adenosine when the diagnosis is in doubt. Atypical VT (torsade de pointes, or twisting of the points) occurs when the QRS axis swings from a positive to a negative direction in a single lead at a rate of 200 to 240 beats/min (Fig. 2-15). Drugs that further prolong repolarization-quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants-exacerbate this arrhythmia.

after  the  initial  bolus.  Second-line  agents  include  procainamide  (in patients without suspected MI or LV dysfunction) and lidocaine.

# undifferentiated Wide Complex Tachycardia

Patients with wide complex tachycardia should be approached as having VT until proven otherwise. Age over 35 years, a history of MI, CHF, or coronary artery bypass grafting strongly favor VT. ECG signs favoring VT include AV dissociation, fusion beats, precordial lead QRS concordance, and  a  QRS  duration  longer  than  0.14  second.  It  is  a  misconception  that patients with VT are typically unstable. At the bedside, one should assume any new and symptomatic wide complex tachycardia is ventricular in origin and focus on treating the rhythm as VT, as well as any contributing cause, especially in the unstable patient.

# Ventricular Fibrillation

# Clinical Features

VF is the totally disorganized depolarization and contraction of small areas of ventricular myocardium during which there is no effective ventricular pumping activity. The ECG shows a fine-to-coarse zigzag pattern without discernible P waves or QRS complexes (Fig. 2-16). VF is seen most commonly in patients with severe ischemic heart disease, with or without an acute MI. It also can be caused by digoxin or quinidine toxicity, hypothermia, chest trauma, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, or mechanical stimulation (e.g., catheter wire). Primary VF occurs suddenly, without preceding hemodynamic deterioration, and usually is due to acute ischemia or peri-infarct

scar  reentry.  Secondary VF  occurs  after  a  prolonged  period  of  hemodynamic deterioration due to left ventricular failure or circulatory shock.

# ■ DYSRHYTHMIA-ASSOCIATED CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES

# Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome

WPW syndrome is the most common form of ventricular  preexcitation involving  an  accessory  conduction  pathway  that  bypasses  the AV  node (Fig.  2-17).  The  ventricles  are  activated  by  an  impulse  from  the  atria sooner than would be expected if the impulse were transmitted down the normal  conducting  pathway.  This  premature  activation  causes  initial fusion beat morphology with slurring of initial QRS complex, causing the pathognomonic  delta  wave. Among  patients  with WPW-PSVT,  80%  to 90% will conduct in the orthodromic direction and the remaining 10% to 20% will conduct in the antidromic direction. ECG findings of atrial fibrillation or flutter with antidromic conduction down the bypass tract show a wide  QRS  complex  that  is  irregular  with  a  rate  faster  than  180  to  200 beats/min (see Atrial Fibrillation).

# Brugada Syndrome and Long-QT Syndrome

Brugada syndrome and long-QT syndrome increase the risk of spontaneous  VT/VF  and  require  evaluation  for  implantable  cardiac  defibrillator placement when diagnosed. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder of fast sodium channels causing an RBBB pattern in the early precordial leads (V1-2)  with  a  pathognomonic  J-point  elevation  and  saddle-shaped  or sloped ST segment (Fig. 2-18). Long-QT syndrome is characterized by a QT  interval  greater  than  470  milliseconds  in  men  and  greater  than 480 milliseconds in women and may be congenital or acquired, leading to an increased risk of torsades de pointes. The risk of arrhythmia increases significantly with QTc durations greater than 500 milliseconds.

# ■ pRETERMINAL RHYTHMS

# Pulseless electrical Activity

Pulseless electrical activity is the presence of electrical complexes without accompanying mechanical contraction of the heart. Potential mechanical causes  should  be  diagnosed  and  treated,  including  severe  hypovolemia, cardiac  tamponade,  tension  pneumothorax,  massive  pulmonary  embolus, MI, and toxic ingestions  (e.g.,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  calcium  channel blockers, β -blockers). In addition, profound metabolic abnormalities such as  acidosis,  hypoxia,  hypokalemia,  hyperkalemia,  and  hypothermia  also should be considered and treated.

After intubation and initiating CPR, administer epinephrine 1  mg IV/ IO (1:10,000 solution) every 3 to 5 minutes. If giving via endotracheal tube, increase the dose 2 to 2.5 times and follow with several rapid ventilations to disperse the drug. Treatment is guided by rapid identification and treatment of the underlying cause. Use agents with α -adrenergic activity, such as norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to improve vascular tone when indicated. Electrical pacing is not effective.

# Asystole (Cardiac Standstill)

Asystole is the complete absence of cardiac electrical activity and carries a  grim  prognosis. Treatment is the same as that for pulseless electrical activity.

Pacemakers, AICDs, or combination units may be used in patients with a history  of  sudden  death,  heart  failure,  or  cardiomyopathy.  Malfunction can occur at any level of the device, including infection or hematoma in the  pocket  housing  the  device,  lead  infection/displacement,  failure  to pace,  failure  to  sense,  overpacing,  or  inappropriate  defibrillation.  Most pacemakers  will  have  a  magnetic  switch  which,  when  triggered  by magnet application to the unit, will cause the pacemaker to function in a fixed asynchronous mode.

Children primarily develop cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia from respiratory  arrest  or  shock  syndromes.  Because  of  age  and  size  differences among children, equipment sizes also differ (Table 3-1).

# ■ PEDIATRIC CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION

# Securing the Airway

The airway in infants and children is smaller, variable in size, and higher and more anterior than that in the adult. The prominent occiput and relatively large tongue and epiglottis may lead to obstruction when the child is in the supine position.

Mild extension of the neck in the sniffing position opens the airway. This may be maintained by placing a towel beneath the shoulders. Chin lift or jaw thrust maneuvers may relieve obstruction of the airway related to the tongue. Oral airways are not commonly used in pediatrics but may be useful in the unconscious child who requires continuous jaw thrust or chin lift to maintain airway patency. Oral airways are inserted by direct visualization with a tongue blade.

A bag-valve-mask system is commonly used for ventilation. Minimum volume for ventilation bags for infants and children is 450 mL. The tidal volume necessary  to  ventilate  children  is  8  to  10  mL/kg.  Observation  of chest rise and auscultation of breath sounds will ensure adequate ventilation.

Endotracheal  intubation  usually  is  performed  with  a  Miller  straight blade with a properly sized tube. Resuscitation measuring tapes have been found to be the most accurate for determining tube size. The formula 16 plus age in years divided by 4 calculates approximate tube size. Uncuffed tubes are commonly used in children up to 8 years, but cuffed tubes can be used in younger children as well.

Respiratory rates should be started at 20 breaths/min for infants beyond the neonatal period, 15 breaths/min for young children, and 10 breaths/min for adolescents unless hyperventilation is required.

# Rapid Sequence Intubation

Rapid  sequence  intubation  is  the  administration  of  an  intravenous  (IV) anesthetic with a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation, and is associated with the highest success and lowest complication rates, compared to other methods. See Table 3-2 for common medications for rapid sequence intubation.

32 SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

# Vascular Access

Vascular access is obtained in the quickest, least invasive manner possible; peripheral veins (antecubital, hand, foot, or scalp) are tried first. Intraosseous access is also a quick, safe, and reliable route for resuscitation medications, especially  in  the critically ill  infant  or  child  suffering  from hypovolemia or shock. Percutaneous access of the femoral vein or saphenous vein cutdown may be attempted, but is more time consuming. Airway management is paramount in pediatric arrest, and should not be delayed while obtaining vascular access.

The technique for insertion of the intraosseous line is as follows: the bone  most  commonly  used  is  the  proximal  tibia.  The  anterior  tibial tuberosity is palpated with the index finger. The cannulation site is 1 to 3 cm below this tuberosity and in the middle of the anteromedial surface of the tibia. Manual and powered devices are commonly used. If a bone marrow needle is not available, an 18-G spinal needle can be used but is prone  to  bending.  With  sterile  technique,  the  needle  is  inserted  in  a slightly caudal direction until the needle punctures the cortex. The stylet is removed, and marrow is aspirated to confirm placement. If no marrow is aspirated but the needle is thought to be in place, flushing the needle may  be  attempted.  Fluids  or  drugs  (including  glucose,  epinephrine, dopamine, anticonvulsants, and antibiotics) may then be administered as with a standard IV.

# Fluids

In hypotension or frank shock, IV isotonic fluid (i.e., normal saline solution)  boluses  of  20  mL/kg  should  be  given  as  rapidly  as  possible  and potentially repeated, depending on the clinical response. If hypovolemia has  been  corrected  and  shock  or  hypotension  persist,  a  pressor  agent should be considered.

# Drugs

The  indications  for  resuscitation  drugs  are  the  same  for  children  as  for adults; the exception is epinephrine, which is considered first-line therapy in children with bradycardia (Table 3-3).

Proper drug dosages in children require knowledge of the patient's weight. The use of a length-based system for estimating the weight of a child in an emergency situation reduces dosage errors when an exact weight is unavailable and cannot be safely obtained due to the patient's medical condition.

The rule of 6s may be used to quickly calculate continuous drug infusions of drugs such as dopamine and dobutamine. The calculation is 6 mg times weight in kilograms: fill to 100 mL with 5% dextrose in water. The infusion rate in milliliters per hour equals the microgram per kilogram per minute rate (i.e., an infusion running at 1 mL/h = 1 μ g/kg/min, or 5 mL/h = 5 μ g/kg/min).

Epinephrine is  indicated  in  pulseless  arrest  and  in  hypoxia-induced bradycardia unresponsive to oxygenation and ventilation. The initial dose is  0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1:10,000 solution) IV/IO or 0.1 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg)  of  1:1,000  solution  by  endotracheal  route.  Subsequent  doses  of epinephrine are at the same dose and concentration and may be administered every 3-5 minutes.

34 SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

Sodium bicarbonate is no longer recommended as a first-line resuscitation drug. It is recommended only with persistent acidosis after the establishment of effective ventilation, administration of epinephrine, and performance of chest compressions to ensure adequate circulation.

Calcium also is not recommended in routine resuscitation but may be useful in hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and calcium-channel blocker overdose. Calcium may be given as calcium chloride, 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg of 10% solution) or calcium gluconate, 60-100 mg/kg (0.6-1 mL/kg of 10% solution) via IV or IO route.

# Dysrhythmias

Dysrhythmias in infants and children are most often the result of respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia, not of primary cardiac causes, as in adults. Careful attention to oxygenation and ventilation therefore are cornerstones of dysrhythmia management in children.

The most common rhythm seen in pediatric arrest situations is bradycardia  leading  to  asystole.  Oxygenation  and  ventilation  are  often  sufficient therapy in this situation. Epinephrine may be useful if the child is unresponsive to this respiratory intervention.

The  next  most  common  dysrhythmia  in  children  is  supraventricular tachycardia  (SVT),  which  presents  with  a  narrow-complex  tachycardia with rates between 250 and 350 beats/min. On EKG, p waves are either absent or abnormal. Adenosine 0.1 mg/kg given via rapid IV push followed by a normal saline flush through a well-functioning IV line as close to the central circulation as possible is the recommended treatment for stable SVT in  children.  This  dose  may  be  doubled  if  the  first  dose  is  unsuccessful. Treatment of unstable SVT is synchronized cardioversion at 0.5-1 J/kg. If  not  effective,  increase  to  2  J/kg.  Sedation  prior  to  cardioversion  is recommended.

It may be difficult to distinguish between a fast sinus tachycardia and SVT. Young infants may have sinus tachycardia with rates as fast as 200220 beats/min. The presence of normal p waves is strongly suggestive of sinus  tachycardia  rather  than  SVT.  Patients  with  sinus  tachycardia  may have a history of fever, dehydration, or shock, while SVT is usually associated with a vague, nonspecific history.

# Defibrillation and Cardioversion

Ventricular  fibrillation  and  ventricular  tachycardia  are  rare  in  children. When present, immediate defibrillation at 2 J/kg is recommended. Immediately  after  defibrillation,  give  2  minutes  of  high-quality  uninterrupted CPR (five cycles of 15:2 compressions and ventilations) to restore coronary perfusion  and  improve  oxygen  delivery  to  the  myocardium  before  additional attempts at defibrillation. If the first defibrillation attempt is unsuccessful,  the  energy  is  doubled  to  4  J/kg  for  each  subsequent  attempt. Epinephrine  may  also  be  given  and  oxygenation  and  acid-base  status should be reassessed. Synchronized cardioversion is used to treat unstable tachydysrhythmias at a dose of 0.5 J/kg. Double the energy level to 1 J/kg if the first attempt is unsuccessful.

The largest paddles that still allow contact of the entire paddle with the chest wall are used. Electrode cream or paste is used to prevent burns. One

paddle is placed on the right of the sternum at the second intercostal space, and  the  other  is  placed  at  the  left  midclavicular  line  at  the  level  of  the xiphoid.

# ■ NEONATAL RESUSCITATION

Most  newborns  do  not  require  specific  resuscitation  after  delivery,  but about 6% of newborns require some form of life support in the delivery room.  Emergency  departments,  therefore,  must  be  prepared  to  provide neonatal resuscitation in the event of delivery in the emergency department.

Management of fluids, electrolytes, and acid-base disorders in the emergency department (ED) involves immediate correction of life-threatening abnormalities, identification and treatment of the underlying disorder, and eventual restoration of normal tissue homeostasis.

# ■ FLUIDS

Crystalloid fluids for human administration have three general components: water, electrolytes, and glucose (Table 4-1).

Because  the  osmolarity  of  normal  saline  (NS)  and  Lactated  Ringer's solution  matches  that  of  serum,  they  are  excellent  fluids  for  volume replacement. Dextrose solutions are hypotonic and should never be used to replace  volume but may be given as maintenance fluids with or without potassium.

# Hypovolemia and Hypervolemia

Hypovolemia or hypervolemia can be determined entirely from the history and physical examination. History of bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and/or findings of dry mucous membranes with features of poor perfusion, for  example,  decreased capillary refill,  reduced  urine  output,  and  altered

level of consciousness are suggestive of hypovolemia. Lethargy and coma are more ominous signs and may indicate a significant comorbid condition. Risk factors for hypervolemia include renal, cardiovascular, and liver diseases.  Edema  (central  or  peripheral),  respiratory  distress  (pulmonary edema),  and  jugular  venous  distention  (in  congestive  heart  failure)  are clinical features of hypervolemia.

Blood pressure and heart rate do not necessarily correlate with volume  status  alone  and  laboratory  values  are  not  reliable  indicators  of fluid status. Bedside ultrasound can be used to assess the volume status as  an  adjunct  to,  not  a  replacement  for,  the  physical  exam.  Measurements of the IVC and following changes in size and respiratory dynamics  over  time  with  fluid  challenges  effectively  determine  the  vascular volume status.

# ■ eLeCtrOLYte DISOrDerS

Management of electrolyte disorders is guided by two variables: severity of symptoms and rate of onset. If the clinical picture and the laboratory data conflict, repeat the lab test prior to initiating therapy. Abnormalities should be corrected at the same rate they develop; however, slower correction is usually  safer  unless  in  life-threatening  situations  which  warrant  rapid  or early intervention.

# Hyponatremia ([Na + ] < 138 mEq/l)

Hyponatremia is a condition of excess water relative to [Na + ].

# Clinical Features

Symptomatic  hyponatremia  rarely  occurs  until  [Na + ]  falls  below  135 mEq/L or lower. Symptoms can be divided into moderately severe ([Na + ] < 130  mEq/L)-headache,  nausea,  disorientation,  confusion,  agitation, ataxia, and areflexia, and severe ([Na + ] < 120 mEq/L)-intractable vomiting,  seizures,  coma,  and  ultimately  respiratory  arrest  due  to  brainstem herniation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Evaluate volume status plus measure and calculate plasma osmolality. The formula to calculate effective osmolality is

If values are in SI units (e.g., mmol/L), do not divide by their molecular weight.

In true hyponatremia, plasma osmolality is reduced; in factitious hyponatremic  states,  for  example,  in  the  presence  of  hyperproteinemia  and hyperlipidemia, it is normal or increased due to the displacement of serum water  by  elevated  concentration  of  lipids  or  protein  creating  laboratory misinterpretation of normal [Na + ].

The diagnosis of hyponatremia and its subtypes is based on the clinical findings  of  volume  status  in  association  with  specific  laboratory  values including serum [Na + ],  serum  osmolality,  volume status, urinary sodium (U Na + ), and urine osmolality (U osm ) (Table 4-2).

Two important hyponatremic disorders are the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (Table 4-3) and the less common cerebral salt-wasting syndrome.  Both  conditions  are  diagnoses  of  exclusion  after  dismissing other causes of hyponatremia.

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA  or  Ecstasy)  induces  inappropriate secretion of ADH and causes increased gut water absorption, and intoxication  may  lead  to  profound  hyponatremia  (see  also  Chapter  105, 'Drugs of Abuse').

TABlE 4-4 | treatment for hyponatremia Symptomatic with Seizures or Coma
Step 1 | Assess for indication for 3% hypertonic saline: severe symptoms of hyponatremia such as seizures or coma with suspected impending brainstem herniation in setting of acute * or chronic † hyponatremia
Step 2 | Infuse 100 mL of 3% hypertonic saline IV over 10-15 min ‡
Step 3 | Measure serum sodium level after each 3% hypertonic saline infusion
Step 4 | Stop infusion when symptoms improve, or a target of 5 mEq/L (range 4-6 mEq/L) increase in serum sodium concentration is achieved.
Step 5 | May repeat 100 ml of 3% hypertonic saline up to three total doses, or a total of 300 ml IV of 3% hypertonic saline.
Step 6 | Keep the IV line open with minimal volume of 0.9% normal saline until cause-specific treatment is started. Limit increase in sodium level to no more than 8 mEq/L during the first 24 hours.
--- [END OF TABLE] ---

* Both European guidelines and U.S. expert panel recommend 3% hypertonic saline infusion for acute life-threatening hyponatremia, which is most commonly due to self-induced water intoxication during endurance exercise, psychiatric illness, in association with ethylenedioxymethamphetamine intoxication, or intracranial pathology or increased intracranial pressure.

† European guidelines state that regardless of onset of acute or chronic hyponatremia, presence of seizures or coma is an indication for brief infusion of hypertonic saline to improve symptoms.

‡ European guidelines recommend a prompt 150-mL 3% hypertonic saline infusion over 20 minutes, then checking the serum sodium concentration after 20 minutes while repeating an infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline for the next 20 minutes, repeating this sequence up to twice more, and stopping with clinical improvement or when target sodium level is reached.

TBW estimates  are  based  on  age,  sex,  and  weight  of  the  patient.  In children  and  adult  males < 65 years old, TBW is 60% of the weight; in adult females < 65 years old and elderly males, TBW is 50% of the weight, in elderly females, TBW is 45% of weight. Three percent hypertonic saline contains  513  mEq/L  of  sodium  while  isotonic  (0.9%)  saline  contains 154 mEq/L of sodium.

# Hypernatremia ([Na + ] > 145 mEq/l)

Hypernatremia  is  defined  as  serum  or  plasma  [Na + ] > 145  mEq/L  and hyperosmolality (serum osmolality > 295 mOsm/L).

# Clinical Features

History  may  reveal  nausea  and  vomiting,  lethargy,  weakness,  increased thirst, low water intake, salt intake, and polyuria ( > 3000 mL of urine per 24 hours).  Hypotension, tachycardia,  orthostatic  blood  pressures,  sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes (symptoms of hypovolemia), altered mental status, poor skin turgor, or edema in hypervolemic hypernatremia may be present on physical examination. Without intervention, coma, seizures, and shock may occur.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Based on volume status, hypernatremia may be classified as hypervolemic hypernatremia (increased total body Na + with normal or increased TBW), normovolemic hypernatremia (near normal total body Na + and decreased TBW), or hypovolemic hypernatremia (decreased TBW and total body Na + with a relatively greater decrease in TBW) (Table 4-5).

where TBW is calculated based on age and sex (see hyponatremia treatment section for scale), P osm = 2 × [Na + ] + glucose/18, and 285 is used as normal plasma osmolality. In an alert patient capable of safely drinking water, give two-thirds free water orally and one-third IV in the form of D5W.

In acute hypernatremia (onset over less than 48 hours), correct at a rate of 1 mEq/L/h. In cases of a lethal sodium chloride ingestion/load (0.75 to 3.0  g/kg) < 6  hours  prior  to  presentation,  FWD  may  be  replaced  rapidly with no reported adverse events. In cases of chronic hypernatremia, correct (lower) the sodium level at a rate of no more than 0.5 mEq/L/h or 10 to 12 mEq/24 h to avoid the risk of cerebral edema.

# Hypokalemia ([K + ] < 3.5 mEq/l)

# Clinical Features

Symptoms of hypokalemia (Table 4-6) usually start when serum concentrations  reach  2.5  mEq/L,  although  they  may  appear  sooner  with  rapid decreases  in  concentration  or  appear  later  (i.e.,  at  even  lower  [K + ])  for chronic depletion.

# Clinical Features

Cardiac dysrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, sinoatrial and atrioventricular  blocks  until  complete  heart  block,  and  asystole,  may  occur. Death from hyperkalemia is usually the result of diastolic arrest or ventricular fibrillation. Other common symptoms include neuromuscular dysfunctional  weakness,  paresthesias,  areflexia,  ascending  paralysis,  and  GI effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).

# Hypermagnesemia

# Clinical Findings

Magnesium decreases the transmission of neuromuscular messages and thus  acts  as  a  CNS  depressant  and  decreases  neuromuscular  activity (Table 4-13).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Serum [Mg 2+ ] is usually diagnostic. Consider hypermagnesemia in patients with  hyperkalemia  or  hypercalcemia.  Hypermagnesemia  also  should  be suspected in patients with renal failure, particularly in those who are taking magnesium-containing antacids or laxatives (Table 4-14).

# Hypercalcemia (total [Ca 2+ ] > 10.5 mg/dl or an ionized [Ca 2+ ] > 2.7 mEq/l)

# Clinical Features

Hypercalcemic patients with plasma total [Ca 2+ ] < 12.0 mg/dL are usually asymptomatic,  but  higher  levels  can  cause  a  wide  variety  of  symptoms (Table 4-17).

A mnemonic sometimes used for the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia is stones (renal calculi), bones (osteolysis), moans (psychiatric disorders), and groans (peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, and constipation).

On  ECG,  hypercalcemia  may  be  associated  with  depressed  ST  segments,  widened T  waves,  and  shortened  ST  segments  and  QT  intervals. Bradyarrhythmias may occur, with bundle-branch patterns that may progress  to  second-degree  block  or  complete  heart  block.  Levels  of  [Ca 2+ ] above 20 mg/dL may cause cardiac arrest.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A  corrected  calcium  level  should  be  calculated  if  albumin  is  not  in  the normal range:

Corrected Ca 2 + ( mg / dL )

=

Measured total Ca 2 + ( mg / dL ) + 0.8 ( 4.0 -Serum albumin [ g / dL ])

where 4.0 represents the average albumin level in g/dL. If the reference lab reports values in mmol/L, use the following formula:

# Corrected Ca 2 + ( mmol / L ) =

Measured total Ca 2 + ( mmol / L ) + 0.02 ( 40 -Serum albumin [ grams / L ])

where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L.

More than 90% of occurrences are associated with hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, the latter being the most likely presentation in the ED (Table 4-18).

# Hyperphosphatemia ([PO 3 4 -] > 4.5 mg/dl)

# Clinical Features

The acute symptoms are due to renal failure, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The causes of hyperphosphatemia can be divided into three groups according to mechanism (Table 4-22).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Phosphate binders such as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate may be used. In very high [ PO 3 4 - ] levels, institute hemodialysis.

# ■ aCID-BaSe DISOrDerS

Acid-base disturbances are classified as respiratory or metabolic. Respiratory acid-base disorders are due to primary changes in PCO 2 , and metabolic acid-base disorders reflect primary changes in [ HCO 3 - ] .

# Clinical Features

History should emphasize events that may result in the gain or loss of acid or base, such as vomiting, diarrhea, medications, or ingestions of toxins, and seek evidence of dysfunction of the organs of acid-base homeostasisthe liver, kidneys, and lungs.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis and differential must begin with defining the nature of the acidbase  disorder  and  then  determining  the  most  likely  etiology.  Determine blood  gases  (pH,  PCO 2 ,  and [ HCO 3 - ] )  from  an  arterial  puncture,  though venous or capillary blood may also be used. Evaluate electrolytes ([Na + ], [K + ],  [Cl -],  and [ HCO 3 - ] ),  and other factors that affect the patient's acidbase status (albumin, lactic acid, creatinine, BUN, drug levels of suspected

# Defining the Nature of the Acid-Base Disorder (Figure 4-1)

Use the patient's pre-illness values as a baseline if available; the normal pH range is 7.35 to 7.45 (95% CI), the normal PCO 2 range is 35 to 45 mm Hg (95% CI), and the normal [ HCO 3 - ] is  usually 21 to 28 mEq/L (95% CI). However, a patient's values may all fall within the 'normal range' and still have significant acid-base disturbances.

Virtually all AG values > 15 mEq/L can be considered abnormal, even when there are no previous comparison values available.

# Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may be divided into elevated AG acidosis (Table 4-23) and normal AG acidosis (Table 4-24).

# Clinical Features

Patients may complain of abdominal pain, headache, nausea with or without vomiting, and generalized weakness, and because acidosis stimulates the respiratory center, the patient may complain of dyspnea.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The differential diagnoses to be considered in emergency practice fall into four broad categories: renal failure (uremia), ketoacidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis,  alcoholic  ketoacidosis,  starvation  ketoacidosis),  lactic  acidosis, and ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates, and many others). Lactic acidosis is not a diagnosis, but a syndrome with its own differential diagnosis (Table 4-23).

When given, HCO 3 -be dosed 0.5 mEq/kg for each milliequivalent per liter rise [ HCO 3 - ] desired.  The  goal  is  to  restore  adequate  buffer  capacity ( [ HCO 3 - ] > 8 mEq/L) or to achieve clinical improvement in shock or dysrhythmias. Bicarbonate should be given as slowly as the clinical situation permits. Seventy-five milliliters of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 500 mL of dextrose 5% in water produces a nearly isotonic solution for infusion.

# Metabolic Alkalosis

Metabolic alkalosis results from gain of bicarbonate or loss of acid. It is typically classified as [Cl -] sensitive and [Cl -] insensitive.

# Clinical Features

Patients may complain of generalized weakness, dizziness, myalgia, palpitations, nausea with or without vomiting, paresthesia, and possibly muscle spasm or twitching. Neurologic abnormalities, especially tetany, neuromuscular instability, and seizures, are common.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Conditions  producing  'chloride-responsive  alkalosis'  result  in  chloride loss, for example, vomiting (which also causes acid loss), diarrhea, diuretic therapy,  and  chloride-wasting diseases (e.g.,  cystic  fibrosis  and  chloridewasting enteropathy), which tend to reduce serum chloride concentration and  extracellular  volume.  Conditions  producing  'chloride-unresponsive alkalosis'  and  hypertension  include  renal  artery  stenosis,  renin-secreting tumors,  adrenal  hyperplasia,  hyperaldosteronism,  Cushing's  syndrome, Liddle's  syndrome,  and  exogenous  mineralocorticoids  (e.g.,  licorice, fludrocortisone). Chloride-unresponsive alkalosis caused by Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes is usually associated with normotension. Alkalosis results in reductions in ionized calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# respiratory Acidosis

Respiratory  acidosis  is  defined  by  alveolar  hypoventilation  and  is  diagnosed when the PCO 2 is greater than the expected value.

# Clinical Features

The clinical picture usually is dominated by the underlying disorder. Typically, respiratory acidosis depresses the mental function, which may progressively slow the respiratory rate. Patients may be confused, somnolent, and, eventually, unconscious.

CHAPTER 4: Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid-Base Disorders

# Diagnosis and Differential

Inadequate  ventilation  most  frequently  results  from  head  trauma,  chest trauma, lung disease, or excess sedation. The chronic hypoventilation seen in  extremely  obese  patients  is  often  referred  to  as  the  Pickwickian  Syndrome.  Patients  with  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  have increased dead space and frequently also have decreased minute ventilation. Pulse oximetry may be misleading, making arterial blood gases essential for the diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# respiratory Alkalosis

Respiratory  alkalosis  is  defined  by  alveolar  hyperventilation  and  exists when PCO 2 is less than expected.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms of hyperventilation include dizziness, carpal-pedal spasm, and, frequently, a chest pain described as tightness.

# Diagnosis and Differential

It is caused by conditions that stimulate respiratory centers, including CNS tumors or stroke, infections, pregnancy, hypoxia, and toxins (e.g., salicylates). Anxiety, pain, and iatrogenic overventilation of patients on mechanical ventilators also cause respiratory alkalosis.

Saurin P . Bhatt

Shock is circulatory insufficiency that creates an imbalance between tissue oxygen supply (delivery) and oxygen demand (consumption). Such tissue hypoperfusion  is  associated  with  decreased  venous  oxygen  content  and metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis). Shock is classified into four categories based on etiology: (a) hypovolemic, (b) cardiogenic, (c) distributive (e.g., neurogenic and anaphylactic), and (d) obstructive.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Factors that influence the clinical presentation of a patient in shock include the etiology, duration, and severity of the shock state and the underlying medical status of the patient. Often the precipitating cause of shock may be readily apparent (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, trauma, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, or anaphylaxis). It is not uncommon for the patient to present with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., generalized weakness, lethargy, or altered mental status). A targeted history of the presenting symptoms and previously existing conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, GI bleeding, adrenal insufficiency, or diabetes) will aid in identifying the cause and guide the initial treatment of shock. Drug use (prescribed and nonprescribed) is an essential element of the initial history. Medication use may be the cause or a contributing factor to the evolution of shock. For example, diuretics can lead to volume depletion and cardiovascular medications (e.g., β -blockers) can depress the pumping action of the heart. The possibility of drug toxicity and anaphylactic reactions to medications also should be considered.

Assessment of vital signs is a routine part of the physical examination; however, no single vital sign or value is diagnostic in the evaluation of the presence or absence of shock. The presence of hyperthermia or hypothermia may be a result of endogenous factors (e.g., infections or hypometabolic  states)  or  exogenous  causes  (e.g.,  environmental  exposures).  The heart rate is typically elevated; however, bradycardia may be present with many  conditions,  such  as  excellent  baseline  physiologic  status  (young athletes),  intraabdominal  hemorrhage  (secondary  to  vagal  stimulation), cardiovascular medication use (e.g., β -blockers and digoxin), hypoglycemia, and preexisting cardiovascular disease.

The  respiratory  rate  is  frequently  elevated  early  in  shock.  Increased minute ventilation, increased dead space, bronchospasm, and hypocapnia may be seen. As shock progresses, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and respiratory distress syndrome may occur.

Shock is usually, but not always, associated with systemic arterial hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) below 90 mm Hg. The insensitivity  of  blood  pressure  to  detect  global  tissue  hypoperfusion  has been repeatedly confirmed. Thus, shock may occur with a normal blood pressure, and hypotension may occur without shock. Early in shock, the systolic and diastolic BPs may initially be normal or elevated in response to  a  compensatory  mechanism  such  as  tachycardia  and  vasoconstriction.

60

--- Page 81 ---

CHAPTER 5: Therapeutic Approach to The Hypotensive Patient

61

As the body's compensatory mechanisms fail, BP typically falls. Postural changes in BP, commonly seen with hypovolemic states, will precede overt hypotension. The pulse pressure, the difference between systolic and diastolic BP measurements, may be a more sensitive indicator. The pulse pressure usually rises early in shock and then decreases before a change in the systolic BP is seen.

In addition to these vital sign abnormalities, physical examination findings in shock may include neck vein distention or flattening and cardiac dysrhythmias. A third heart sound (S3) may be auscultated in high-output states. Decreased coronary perfusion pressures can lead to myocardial ischemia, decreased ventricular compliance, increased left ventricular diastolic pressures, and pulmonary edema.

Decreased  cerebral  perfusion  leads  to  mental  status  changes  such  as weakness,  restlessness,  confusion,  disorientation,  delirium,  syncope,  and coma. Patients with long-standing hypertension may exhibit these changes without severe hypotension. Cutaneous manifestations may include pallor, pale  or  dusky  skin,  sweating,  bruising,  petechiae,  cyanosis  (may  not  be evident if the hemoglobin level is less than 5 g/dL), altered temperature, and delayed capillary refill.

GI manifestations resulting from low flow states may include ileus, GI bleeding,  pancreatitis,  acalculous  cholecystitis,  and  mesenteric  ischemia. To conserve water and sodium, levels of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone  are  increased.  This  results  in  a  reduced  glomerular  filtration  rate, redistribution of blood flow from the renal cortex to the renal medulla, and oliguria. In sepsis, a paradoxical polyuria may occur and be mistaken for adequate hydration.

Early in shock a common metabolic abnormality is a respiratory alkalosis. As the shock state continues and compensatory mechanisms begin to fail, anaerobic metabolism occurs, leading to the formation of lactic acid and resulting in a metabolic acidosis. Other metabolic abnormalities that may be seen are hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The clinical presentation and presumed etiology of shock will dictate the diagnostic  studies,  monitoring  modalities,  and  interventions  used.  The approach to each patient must be individualized; however, frequently performed  laboratory  studies  include  complete  blood  count;  platelet  count; electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine determinations; prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times; and urinalysis. Other tests commonly used  are  arterial  blood  gas,  lactic  acid,  fibrinogen,  fibrin  split  products, d-dimer, and cortisol determinations; hepatic function panel; cerebrospinal fluid studies; and cultures of potential sources of infection. A pregnancy test should  be  performed  on  all  females  of  childbearing  potential.  No  single laboratory value is sensitive or specific for shock. Other common diagnostic tests include radiographs (chest and abdominal), electrocardiographs, computed tomography scans (chest, head, abdomen, and pelvis), and echocardiograms. Bedside ultrasound (US) may also help determine the etiology of shock.  The  following  US  views  are  helpful  in  this  assessment:  subcostal cardiac, parasternal long-axis cardiac, apical four-chamber cardiac inferior vena cava, right upper quadrant abdominal, pelvic, and abdominal aorta.

SECTION 1: Resuscitation Techniques

Continuous monitoring of vital signs should be instituted in all patients. Modalities such as pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO 2 , central venous pressure, central  venous O 2 saturation,  cardiac  output,  and  calculation  of  systemic vascular resistance and systemic oxygen delivery may be indicated.

A search to determine the etiology of the shock must be undertaken. Lack  of  response  to  appropriate  stabilization  measures  should  cause  the clinician to evaluate the patient for a more occult cause. First, the physician must be certain that the basic steps of resuscitation have been carried out appropriately.  Consider  whether  or  not  the  patient  has  been  adequately volume  resuscitated.  Early  use  of  vasopressors  may  elevate  the  central venous pressure and mask the presence of continued hypovolemia. Ensure that  all  equipment  is  connected  and  functioning  appropriately.  Carefully expose and examine the patient for occult wounds. Consider less commonly seen diagnoses, such as cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, adrenal insufficiency, toxic or allergic reactions, and occult bleeding (e.g., rupture ectopic  pregnancy,  or  occult  intraabdominal  or  pelvic  bleeding)  in  the patient who is not responding as expected.

Please refer to other chapters in this book regarding the evaluation of the specific forms of shock.

initial  resuscitation  phase.  Due  to  the  increased  cost,  lack  of  proven benefit, and potential for disease transmission (with FFP), the routine use  of  colloids  (5%  albumin,  purified  protein  fraction,  fresh-frozen plasma [FFP], and synthetic colloid solutions [hydroxyethyl starch or dextran 70]) is questionable. Standard therapy in the hemodynamically unstable patient is 20 to 40  mL/kg given rapidly (over 10 to 20 minutes). Because only about 30% of infused isotonic crystalloids remain in the intravascular  space,  it  is  recommended  to  infuse  approximately  three times the estimated blood loss in acute hemorrhagic shock. However, the benefits  of  early  and  aggressive  fluid  replacement  in  these  trauma patients remain unproven as do the benefits of permissive hypotension.

Allergic reactions range from localized urticaria to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis refers to the most severe form of immediate hypersensitivity  reaction  and  encompasses  both  IgE-mediated  reactions  and anaphylactoid  reactions,  which  do  not  require  a  previous  sensitizing exposure.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Anaphylaxis may occur within seconds or be delayed over an hour after an exposure;  rapid  reactions  are  associated  with  higher  mortality.  Common exposures are foods, medications, insect stings, and allergen immunotherapy. Many cases are idiopathic. Criteria for anaphylaxis describe an acute progression of organ system involvement that may lead to cardiovascular collapse.  Organ  system  involvement  can  include  dermatologic  (pruritus, flushing,  urticaria,  erythema  multiforme,  angioedema),  respiratory  tract (dyspnea,  hypoxia,  wheezing,  cough,  stridor),  cardiovascular  (dysrhythmias,  collapse,  arrest),  gastrointestinal  (cramping,  vomiting,  diarrhea), genitourinary  (urgency,  cramping),  and  eye  (pruritus,  tearing,  redness). A  biphasic  response  may  occur  causing  recurrence  of  symptoms  up  to 11  hours  after  the  initial  exposure,  but  clinically  important  events  are uncommon. Patients on β -blockers are susceptible to an exaggerated allergic response and may be refractory to first-line treatment.

Angioedema is caused by edema in the dermis, often of the face, neck, or extremities. Angioedema may accompany allergic reactions, or it may be triggered by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or due to hereditary angioedema. Urticaria is a pruritic cutaneous reaction that may be  associated  with  allergic  reactions  but  may  also  be  nonallergic.  Many urticarial reactions are caused by viruses.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis. A history of exposure to an allergen, such as a new drug, food, or sting may make the diagnosis obvious. There is no specific test to verify the diagnosis in real time. Anaphylaxis should be considered in any rapidly progressing multi-system illness. Workup is directed at ruling out other diagnoses while stabilizing the patient. The differential depends on the organ systems involved and may include myocardial  ischemia,  gastroenteritis,  asthma,  carcinoid,  epiglottitis,  hereditary angioedema, and vasovagal reactions.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

Resuscitation must begin with airway, breathing, and circulation. Patients should be placed on a cardiac monitor with pulse oximetry and intravenous access obtained.

SECTION

# Analgesia, Anesthesia, and Sedation

2

Michael S. Mitchell

Acute pain is the chief complaint for 75% to 80% of all ED visits. Procedural sedation and analgesia often are needed for painful interventions or diagnostic studies.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Responses to pain vary and may include increased heart rate, blood pressure,  respiratory  rate,  and  behavioral  changes,  however  these  responses may only have a mild correlation, so they cannot be relied upon exclusively. Pain is most objectively assessed with the use of several validated pain scales, though these scales may not be as accurate in elderly patients or trauma patients. Pain scales are a mainstay of assessing pain in young children.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

During the primary assessment, determine the patient's perception of the degree of pain and continue to reassess their pain after any intervention. Be aware  that  children  are  vulnerable  to  oligoanalgesia  for  several  reasons including difficulty assessing their pain and provider discomfort as well as unfamiliarity with medication dosing regimens.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions may be helpful for treating  anxiety  and  pain  in  the  ED.  Nonpharmacologic  interventions include  the  application  of  heat  or  cold,  immobilization  and  elevation  of injured extremities, and distraction methods, such as feeding sucrose solution to infants. When pharmacologic intervention is needed, the selection of agent should be guided by the severity of pain necessitating analgesia, the route of delivery, and the desired duration of effects.

# Acute Pain Control

Nonopioid Analgesics,  such  as acetaminophen, 650  to  1000  mg  PO (15  mg/kg  PO  or  PR  in  children)  or  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen, 400 to 800 mg PO (10 mg/kg PO in  children)  can  be  used  to  treat  mild  to  moderate  pain.  Parenteral

67

--- Page 88 ---

68

SECTION 2: Analgesia, Anesthesia, and Sedation

NSAIDs are no more effective than oral medications. Adverse effects of NSAIDS include gastrointestinal irritation, renal dysfunction, platelet dysfunction, and impaired coagulation. Furthermore, NSAIDs increase the risk of cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease. Aspirin should be avoided in children because of an association with Reye syndrome.

Opiates,  such  as morphine, 0.1  mg/kg  IV  (0.1  to  0.2  mg/kg  IV  in children), fentanyl, 1 μg/kg  IV  (1 to 2 µg/kg  in children), and hydromorphone, 0.2 to 1 mg IV (0.01 mg IV in children) are the agents of choice  for  moderate  to  severe  pain.  Children  require  more  opiates proportionate to their weight than adults. The goal of therapy is to titrate the doses  to  effect.  Side  effects  of  opiates  include  respiratory  depression, nausea  and  vomiting,  confusion,  pruritus,  and  urinary  retention.  Oral opioids may be tried as an alternative to parenteral administration, however they can have variable absorption and a slower effect.

Special  caution  should  be  given  to  the  use  of  codeine  and  tramadol. Codeine is not a reliable analgesic as up to 10% of the US population lack the necessary enzyme to convert it to its active state. Tramadol can produce significant CNS toxicity.

# Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA)

Procedural sedation is the use of medication to induce a depressed level of consciousness while maintaining cardiorespiratory function so that a painful  procedure  can  be  performed.  There  are  various  levels  of  sedation achieved  with  different  medications.  See  Table  7-1.  Be  aware  that  with increased depth of sedation, the risk of depressed breathing and potential loss of airway patency is increased.

# Preparation

Recent oral intake is not a contraindication to procedural sedation in the emergency department. If concerned, however, waiting 3 hours after last oral intake is associated with a low risk of aspiration regardless of the level of sedation. The complication rate of PSA depends strongly on depth of sedation and patient's physiological reserve as determined by chronic or acute  illness.  Consider  anesthesia  consultation  for  patients  with  significantly limited physiologic reserve, especially cardiorespiratory conditions,

those with severe systemic disease, at the extremes of age, and those with predicted difficult airway.

When PSA is performed, necessary equipment includes a continuous cardiac  monitor  with  pulse  oximetry,  oxygen,  suction,  and  immediate availability of appropriately sized resuscitation equipment. Informed consent should be obtained. The patient should be under constant observation by a provider trained in airway management. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory  rate,  and  level  of  consciousness  should  be  monitored.  Some advocate  routine  use  of  capnography  to  monitor  ventilation  in  sedated patients,  as  it  has  been  shown  to  detect  changes  in  ventilation  before clinical observation allowing for earlier recognition of adverse events. The application  of  supplemental  oxygen  reduces  hypoxemia  and  has  no adverse clinical effects.

The analgesic or sedative agents chosen should be individualized to the patient and the planned procedure. The agents used for PSA often have a narrow therapeutic index. Therefore, these medications should be administered in small, incremental intravenous doses, with adequate time between doses  to  determine  peak  effect.  All  patients  undergoing  PSA  should  be reassessed continuously. Patients experiencing transient respiratory depression can usually be managed by bag-mask ventilation.

# Sedation Management

Table 7-2 describes selected sedation agents for procedural sedation.

Nitrous Oxide is used for minimal sedation and is supplied in a 50:50 mixture with oxygen. It requires a special setup of a demand delivery system and a scavenging system to prevent exam room accumulation of nitrous oxide. It is contraindicated in pregnant women and those with pneumothorax, pneumocephalus, and vascular air embolus.

Fentanyl has a rapid onset of action and is easily titratable. Chest wall rigidity unresponsive to naloxone may occur at higher doses (5 to 15 mcg/ kg) or when rapidly administered potentially necessitating neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation. Slow administration (e.g., over 3 to 5 minutes) and careful flushing of the IV can prevent rigid chest syndrome.

Midazolam is  commonly  used  as  a  sole  agent  for  minimal  sedation. Respiratory depression and hypotension may develop. Flumazenil quickly reverses sedation and respiratory depression due to benzodiazepines. Routine use to reverse sedation is not recommended.

Ketamine is  a  dissociative  analgesic  with  sedative,  analgesic,  and amnestic properties that causes minimal respiratory depression and has a minimal effect on blood pressure. Ketamine may be administered IV or IM. In lower doses, it can produce analgesia. In higher doses (approximately 1mg/kg and above IV) a critical dosing threshold is exceeded and produces a  dissociative  state.  Ketamine  may  cause  increased  intraocular  pressure, hypersalivation, laryngospasm, and a hallucinatory emergence reaction in older children and adults. Ketamine can cause vomiting, especially in adolescents. Pretreatment with ondansetron can reduce the incidence of vomiting. There is conflicting data on whether ketamine causes increased intracranial pressure, thus there is no concluding evidence to restrict its use in head injury patients. Emergence reaction is best treated with midazolam (0.1  mg/kg IM or IV). Ketamine is contraindicated in children less than 3 months as well as those with increased intraocular pressure or obstructive

Etomidate is  a  rapid  onset  sedative  with  short  duration  of  effect.  It causes temporary adrenal insufficiency which is associated with increased mortality in critically-ill patients; however, this effect has not been shown to cause adverse events when used in stable patients. Up to 20% of patients can have myoclonic jerking.

Propofol is an anesthetic agent administered by intravenous infusion that has a short duration of effect, which results in shorter recovery time and ED length of stay. The most common side effect is respiratory depression and apnea. Side effects include hypotension, therefore hypovolemia should be corrected before propofol administration. Adjunct analgesic is mandatory for painful procedures. Pain at the IV site is common during administration and can be blunted with adjunct use of lidocaine (e.g., 0.05 mg/kg IV). Propofol use is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to eggs or soy products.

Ketamine and Propofol can be used in combination and may have synergy with each other. Ketamine may blunt the hypotension and respiratory depression seen with propofol. Propofol may prevent the emergence reaction and vomiting seen with ketamine. Ketamine use precludes the use of an analgesic with propofol alone. The greatest advantage of using this combination is likely that sedation can be achieved with lower doses of either drug used alone.

# elderly

Procedural  sedation  in  the  elderly  is  associated  with  increased  adverse events.  The  risk  of  respiratory  depression  is  increased  with  all  agents. Etomidate  is  a  good  choice  owing  to  its  minimal  cardiovascular  effects. When using propofol in this age group, the initial and subsequent doses should be 50% of those recommended for younger adults.

# Children

Children of all ages feel pain, even neonates. Anxiety issues, pain control, and need for sedation must be addressed. Anxiety may be a significant barrier to a successful procedure performance, especially when patient's cooperation is needed. Parents can provide significant anxiety relief and should be  allowed  to  stay  with  children. Age  appropriate  distraction  techniques should  also  be  employed.  Benzodiazepines,  such  as  midazolam,  provide effective  pharmacologic  anxiety  relief  when  needed.  Oral  sucrose  is  an effective  analgesic  in  infants  undergoing  painful  procedures  such  as  IV catheter placement. Procedural sedation and analgesia should be used when performing painful procedures or when procedures require the patient to be still. Common medications used for pediatric procedural sedation are listed in Table 7-3.

# Disposition

Patients  are  eligible  for  discharge  only  when  fully  recovered. When  discharged, the patient must be accompanied by an adult and should not drive or operate machinery for 24 hours. Because many of the agents used for PSA produce anterograde amnesia, discharge instructions must be given to responsible accompanying adults.

74 SECTION 2: Analgesia, Anesthesia, and Sedation

# local and Regional Anesthesia

Local and regional anesthetics are essential tools for ED pain management. Agents can be administered topically, intravenously, by infiltration directly into the area to be anesthetized, or into the area of the peripheral nerves supplying the area. This discussion focuses on topical and infiltrative anesthetics.

The toxicity of local anesthetics (LAs) is related to the total dose and the rate of plasma concentration increase. The risk of toxicity is heightened in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis. Toxic effects include CNS effects progressing to coma and cardiovascular effects progressing to cardiovascular  collapse.  Allergic  reactions  to  LAs  are  uncommon  and  are usually due to a preservative. If an allergy is suspected, the best approach is to use a preservative-free agent from the other class of LAs. Alternatively, diphenhydramine or benzyl alcohol may be used as an LA in the setting of a true allergy to conventional LAs.

LAs often cause pain during administration. Slow injection through a 27- or 30-gauge needle, injecting through the wound margin, using warm solution, and using buffered (with sodium bicarbonate) solution decrease injection pain.

Epinephrine (1:100 000) is often added to LAs before administration. Addition  of  epinephrine  increases  the  duration  of  anesthesia,  provides wound hemostasis, and slows systemic absorption. Epinephrine is safe for use  in  end-arterial  fields,  but  should  be  avoided  in  those  with  suspected digital vascular injury or those with known peripheral vascular disease.

Lidocaine, which is the most commonly used LA in the ED, has a 2- to 5-minute onset of effect and a 1- to 2-hour duration of effect. The maximum dose of infiltrative lidocaine is 4.5 mg/kg without or 7 mg/kg with epinephrine. Lidocaine is buffered to decrease the pain of injection by adding 1 mL NaHCO 3 to 9 mL lidocaine, but for maximum effectiveness, it should only be added immediately before use.

Bupivacaine, which has an onset of effect of 3 to 7 minutes and duration of effect of 90 minutes to 6 hours, is preferred for prolonged procedures. The maximum dose of infiltrative bupivacaine is 2 mg/kg without or 3 mg/kg with epinephrine. Buffer bupivacaine with 1 mL NaHCO 3 to 29 mL bupivacaine.

# Local Anesthetic Infiltration

LAs can provide anesthesia at a site by infiltrating directly into the site or by infiltrating  around  the  peripheral  nerves  supplying  the  site.  For  some wounds, LA infiltration around the peripheral nerves is advantageous due to decreased total LA required and decreased pain at the site of injection. During administration, the syringe plunger must be drawn back to avoid intravascular injection of LA.

# Topical Anesthetics

Topical anesthetics can eliminate the need for LA infiltration, are applied painlessly, do not distort wound edges, and may provide hemostasis. Common  preparations  include  lidocaine,  epinephrine,  and  tetracaine  (LET), lidocaine  and  prilocaine  (EMLA),  and  various  preparations  of  lidocaine. LET is applied by placing a LET-saturated cotton ball or gauze pad onto an

--- Page 95 ---

CHAPTER 7: Acute Pain Management and Procedural Sedation

75

open wound for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes. LET should not be used on mucus membranes or in end-arterial fields.

EMLA is a cream composed of lidocaine and prilocaine used only on intact skin to relieve the pain associated with venipuncture, arterial puncture,  port  access,  and  other  superficial  skin  procedures.  It  has  a  45-  to 60-minute  onset  of  effect  and  a  60-minute  duration  upon  withdrawal. Because prilocaine may cause methemoglobinemia, EMLA should be used with caution in infants younger than 3 months and avoided in patients predisposed to methemoglobinemia.

# Regional Blocks

Regional anesthesia is  a  technique  that  infiltrates  local  anesthetic  agents adjacent  to  peripheral  nerves  ("nerve  blocks")  and  is  typically  used  for complicated lacerations, fractures, and dislocations. Distortion of the site is avoided. US guidance can be used. Care must be taken not to inject the anesthetic  solution  directly  into  the  nerve.  Prior  to  anesthetic  use,  distal neurovascular and neurologic status should be assessed. This chapter will discuss commonly used regional blocks in basic descriptions.

# Digital Blocks

Purpose: Finger and toe blocks are advantageous because less anesthetic is needed,  better  anesthesia  is  obtained,  and  tissues  are  not  distorted.  The onset of anesthesia is delayed when compared with that of LA. Assess and document neurovascular status before the procedure.

Positioning: Place  the  hand  in  the  prone  (palm  down)  position.  The nerves travel on the lateral aspect of the finger on both the dorsal and palmar sides.

Technique: Insert the needle on the dorsal surface of the proximal phalanx and advance toward the volar surface staying immediately adjacent to the phalanx. Aspirate to ensure no vascular puncture has occurred and inject 1 mL of anesthetic. Slowly retract the needle while injecting another 1 mL of anesthetic. Prior to withdrawing the needle, direct it across the dorsum to  the  other  side  of  the  digit  and  inject  1  mL  while  withdrawing  slowly. Repeat the first injection on the other side of the digit. Toes can be blocked in the same manner.

# Flexor Tendon Sheath Digital Nerve Block

Purpose: This is a one-injection alternative to the traditional digit block. Be aware that this technique may not provide adequate anesthesia to the distal fingertip.

Positioning: Place the hand in the supine (palm up) position. Have the patient flex the finger to identify the flexor tendon and its corresponding tendon sheath.

Technique: Inject the needle at the distal palmar crease into the flexor tendon sheath. Once the 'pop' is felt, inject 2 to 3 mL of anesthetic.

# Intercostal Nerve Block

Purpose: This block will provide anesthesia in a band-like fashion above and below the affected rib. These blocks are useful to ameliorate pain from a rib fracture or are useful in tube thoracostomy placement.

--- Page 96 ---

76

SECTION 2: Analgesia, Anesthesia, and Sedation

Positioning: The patient sits upright with the ipsilateral arm raised and resting on the head. The site of injection is either the mid-axillary line of the affected rib or the 'rib angle,' which is approximately 6 cm posterior of the mid-axillary line and immediately lateral to the paraspinous muscles. The 'rib angle' site is preferred to ensure adequate analgesia to all branches of the intercostal nerve.

Technique: Palpate  the  inferior  border  of  the  rib  to  be  blocked  and retract  the  skin  cephalad.  Raise  a  wheal  in  the  subcutaneous  space  and insert the needle bevel up and direct it toward the lower aspect of the bone with needle up and syringe down allowing a needle angle of approximately 10  degrees  off  perpendicular.  Once  bone  is  contacted,  release  the  skin retraction and march the needle caudally until it drops off the bone. Aspirate before injection, and inject 2 to 5 mL of anesthetic. Note that pneumothorax can occur in up to 9% of patients, so close monitoring for respiratory symptoms is recommended for 30 minutes after procedure.

# Femoral Nerve Block

Purpose: The femoral nerve block and a larger block involving the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves ('three-in-one' block) are good for proximal femur fractures and hip fracture patients.

Positioning: The patient lies supine and the inguinal crease is exposed. The femoral nerve is 1 cm lateral to the femoral artery at the inguinal crease and is fairly superficial.

Technique: Ultrasound  guidance  is  recommended.  Locate  the  nerve location as described above and raise a wheal of anesthetic. With US guidance,  direct  the  needle  toward  the  femoral  nerve.  Correct  positioning  is confirmed when the patient reports anterior thigh parathesias. If this is not felt,  the  needle may need to be directed more laterally to find the nerve. Once found, retract the needle slightly and inject approximately 20 mL of anesthetic into the perineural space. To perform the 'three-in-one' block, hold firm pressure distal to the injection site for 5 minutes to help promote cephalad distribution of the anesthetic.

# Hematoma Block

Purpose: This block delivers anesthesia to a fracture site to aid in reduction. Positioning: The patient is supine with the limb placed to access the fracture site.

Technique: A  sterile  approach  is  recommended.  Direct  the  needle toward the fracture site. Aspiration of blood will confirm that the needle is likely within the confines of the hematoma. Inject 5 to 15 mL of anesthetic. Be careful not to exceed the maximum dose of anesthetic.

# Chronic Pain

David M. Cline

# ■ MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN

Chronic pain is a painful condition that lasts longer than 3 months, pain that persists beyond the reasonable time for an injury to heal, or pain that persists 1 month beyond the usual course of an acute disease. Complete eradication of pain is not a reasonable endpoint in most cases. Rather, the goal of therapy is pain reduction and a return to functional status.

# Clinical Features

Signs  and  symptoms  of  chronic  pain  syndromes  are  summarized  in Table  8-1.  Many  of  these  syndromes  will  be  familiar  to  emergency physicians.

Complex regional pain type I, previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and  complex  regional  pain  type  II,  previously  known  as causalgia, may be seen in the emergency department (ED) 2 weeks or more

after an acute injury. These disorders should be suspected when a patient presents with classic symptoms: allodynia (pain provoked with gentle touch of the skin) and a persistent burning or shooting pain. Early associated signs during the disease include edema, warmth, and localized sweating.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  most  important  task  of  the  emergency  physician  is  to  distinguish chronic pain from acute pain that heralds a life- or limb-threatening condition.  A  complete  history  and  physical  examination  should  confirm  the chronic condition or point to the need for further evaluation when unexpected signs or symptoms are elicited.

Rarely, a provisional diagnosis of a chronic pain condition is made for the first time in the ED. The exception is a form of post-nerve injury paincomplex regional pain. The sharp pain from acute injuries, including fractures, rarely continues beyond 2 weeks duration. Pain in an injured body part beyond this period should alert the clinician to the possibility of nerve injury.

Definitive  diagnostic  testing  of  chronic  pain  conditions  is  difficult, requires expert opinion and, often, expensive procedures such as magnetic resonance  imaging,  computed  tomography,  or  thermography.  Therefore, referral  to  the  primary  source  of  care  and  eventual  specialist  referral  are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

# ■ MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ABERRANT DRUG-RELATED BEHAVIOR

The spectrum of patients with aberrant drug-related behavior includes those who have chronic pain and are now dependent on narcotics to 'hustlers' who are obtaining prescription drugs to sell on the street.

# Clinical Features

Because of the wide spectrum of patients with aberrant drug-related behavior, the history given may be factual or fraudulent. Patients with aberrant drug-related behavior may be demanding, intimidating, or flattering. In one ED study, the most common complaints of patients seeking drugs were (in decreasing  order)  back  pain,  headache,  extremity  pain,  and  dental  pain. Many  fraudulent  techniques  are  used,  including  'lost'  prescriptions,  or doctor's note explaining need for opioids, 'impending' surgery, fictitious hematuria with a complaint of kidney stones, self-mutilation, and fictitious injury.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of aberrant drug-related behaviors may not be possible in the ED. The medical record can provide a wealth of information regarding the patient, including documentation proving that the patient is supplying false information. Most states now have controlled drug databases that can be queried. Aberrant drug-related behaviors are listed in Table 8-3. The predictive  behaviors are illegal in many states and form a solid basis to refuse narcotics to the patient.

# Emergency Wound Management

SECTION

3

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Traumatic wounds are regularly encountered problems in the emergency department. It is  important  to  document  important  historical  information such as the mechanism, timing, location of injury, and the degree of contamination. Associated symptoms of pain, swelling, paresthesias, and loss of function should be identified. Determine factors that affect wound healing, such as patient age, location of injury, medications, chronic medical conditions, and previous keloid or scar formation. Adults with the sensation of a foreign body are much more likely to have retained a foreign body that should be removed. Review allergies, particularly to latex, and determine whether tetanus immunization is required (see Chapter 94). When caring for wounds, the ultimate goal is to restore the physical integrity and function of the injured tissue without infection.

When treating a wound, consider factors that impact risks for infection, such as time since injury, mechanism, and location. Shear forces are produced by sharp objects  with  relatively  low  energy,  resulting  in  a  wound with a straight edge and little contamination that can be expected to heal with a good result. Wounds caused by compression forces crush the skin against the underlying bone and often produce stellate lacerations. Tension forces may produce flap-type lacerations with surrounding devitalized tissue and may be more susceptible to infection. Other predictive factors for infection  include  location,  depth,  characteristics,  contamination,  and patient age. The risk of infection also relates to the interaction of bacterial contamination and blood supply. The density of bacteria is quite low over the trunk and proximal arms and legs, and thus these areas have lower risks for infection. Moist areas such as the axilla, perineum, and exposed hands and feet have a higher degree of colonization and may be at higher risk of infection. Wounds located on the face or scalp, both highly vascularized areas, are at lower risk for infection.

Wounds  of  the  oral  cavity  are  heavily  contaminated  with  bacteria, although  evidence  supporting  routine  antibiotic  use  in  simple  intra-oral laceration is inconclusive. Wounds sustained from contaminated objects or environments and animal and human bites have an increased infection risk.

81

--- Page 102 ---

82 SECTION 3: Emergency Wound Management

Wounds contaminated with feces have a high risk of infection even when treated with antibiotic therapy. Although there is no clearly defined relationship  between  time  to  closure  and  infection  rate,  consider  time  since injury when making decisions about wound repair. Delayed primary closure after 4 days of open wound management is recommended for wounds with a high risk for infection during the first care encounter.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Wound examination  is  greatly  facilitated  by  a  cooperative  patient,  good positioning, optimal lighting, and little or no bleeding. A thorough examination will minimize the risk of missed foreign bodies, tendon injuries, and nerve injuries. While performing wound assessment, repositioning the joint or extremity in the position assumed during injury may help identify underlying damaged structures.

Assess wound location, size, shape, margins, and depth. Pay particular attention  to  sensory  and  motor  functions,  tendon  injury,  vascular  compromise, and injuries to specialized structures. Carefully palpate and inspect the wound  and  surrounding  area  to  identify  a  retained  foreign  body  or  bone injury, and consider radiographic imaging when these complicating features are suspected. For wounds overlying joints, consider additional assessment to determine whether a violation of the joint space may have occurred.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Proper wound preparation is an important first step to restoring the integrity and  function  of  the  injured  tissue,  preventing  infection,  and  maximizing cosmetic results.

# Methods for Wound Closure

Corey R. Heitz

Wound closure in the emergency department can reduce the risk of infection, provide for improved cosmetic outcome, and maintain the skin's protective  functions.  Methods  for  wound  repair  include  primary  closure (immediately after injury), secondary closure (allowing a wound to heal on its own, which may be useful for contaminated or infected wounds), and delayed closure (packing the wound and performing closure at a later date once infection is ruled out).

Clinicians should consider several factors when choosing a wound closure method: time since injury, wound tension, whether tension is static or dynamic,  and  risk  of  scar  formation.  The  cosmetic  outcome  after  wound closure is primarily a function of technique and not necessarily reflective of the specific closure method or device that is selected. Options for closure include sutures, staples, adhesive tape, tissue adhesives, and hair apposition.

# ■ SUTURES

Sutures are strong, reliable, and adaptable and allow good approximation of wounds that are under tension. Absorbable suture material loses its tensile strength in < 60 days and thus does not require removal after healing. Nonabsorbable sutures maintain their tensile strength and will require removal after a suitable time period for tissue healing. For most emergency department applications, either choice is acceptable as both have similar rates of infection,  cosmetic  outcomes,  and  wound  dehiscence  risks.  Absorbable sutures are suitable for deep tissue structures such as dermis and fascia or when avoiding the need for suture removal is desired. Often, monofilament nonabsorbable sutures are used due to ease of use, good tensile strength, and low rates of infection. Suture material is available in a wide variety of sizes, with higher gauge sizes (such as 5-0 and 6-0) being very thin with less tensile strength. Smaller gauge sizes (such as 3-0 and 4-0) are larger in diameter with greater strength. Large gauge (e.g., 6-0) is most often chosen for areas of low tension where minimizing scars is desired, such as on the face. Smaller gauge suture (e.g., 3-0) is often used for the scalp, extremities,  or  other  areas  where increased tension requires suture material with greater tensile strength. When placing sutures of any size, be sure to evert the skin edges and avoid applying excessive crushing force on the tissue that can further damage the area and impair healing. Direct pressure, topical vasoconstrictors, or local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor are all useful for achieving hemostasis when repairing a wound.

# ■ SUTURING TECHNIQUES

# Simple Interrupted Percutaneous Sutures

Placing simple interrupted sutures is the easiest and most commonly used technique for wound repair. The needle is introduced on one side of the wound, through the deep tissues, and exits the other side of the wound

85

--- Page 106 ---

86

SECTION 3: Emergency Wound Management

(Fig. 10-1). Be sure to keep the needle tip at 90 degrees to the skin and evert the wound edges for best results, and take care not to pucker the skin when tying the knot. Square knots are generally tied with the number of knots corresponding to the suture gauge (e.g.,four knots when using 4-0 suture material). Position the knots so that they all remain on the same side of the wound.

# Continuous (Running) Percutaneous Sutures

A rapid method for closure of high-tension wounds, this method can be challenging to get cosmetically optimal results in irregularly shaped wounds and

thus is most appropriate for long linear lacerations. Place a suture at one end of the wound, tie, but do not cut the suture material. Then sew back and forth down the wound at a 65 degree angle until the opposite end is reached, at which point the suture material is tied off and cut (Fig. 10-2).

SECTION 3: Emergency Wound Management

# Buried Dermal Sutures

These sutures are placed to reduce tension on the wound and close dead spaces  by  approximating  underlying  structures.  Place  these  sutures  by entering the deep tissues first and exiting in the subcutaneous layer, then entering the other side of the wound in the subcutaneous layer and exiting in the deep tissue (Fig. 10-3). This allows the knot to be buried deep within the tissue and thus should be completed with absorbable suture material. Closing  adipose  tissue  with  deep  sutures  is  unnecessary  as  it  does  not

enhance  cosmetic  outcome  or  wound  healing.  Infection  risks  can  be decreased when clinicians minimize the number of buried sutures used for wound repair.

# Continuous Subcuticular Sutures

A more complex method, subcuticular sutures are performed with absorbable sutures and do not require removal. Begin by anchoring the suture at one end, and then weave horizontally in and out of the dermal-epidermal junction, subcutaneously (Fig. 10-4). This technique allows for excellent approximation of wound edges.

Vertical  mattress  sutures  allow  for  closure  of  deep  and  epidermal  layers with a single suture placement, and allow for excellent wound edge eversion. Enter the wound on one side a few millimeters from the edge, take a

deep bite of tissue, and exit on the other side, similar to a simple interrupted suture technique. Then before tying the knot, reenter the same side of the wound that was just exited at a point closer to the wound edge and then exit in a similar position on the other side in a 'far-far/near-near' fashion for each suture placement (Fig. 10-5).

# Horizontal Mattress Sutures

For horizontal mattress sutures, begin similarly to a simple interrupted suture. Instead of tying the knot after the first suture throw, go several millimeters parallel to the wound and perform another throw, tying the knot on the original side of the wound (Fig 10-6). This technique is useful for wounds with poor circulation and other delicate areas as it distributes wound tension and prevents further skin disruption close to the wound edge.

# Horizontal Half-Buried Mattress Sutures

This technique is useful for skin flaps and stellate lacerations because the suture passes through the dermis of the skin tip and not the epidermal layer.

--- Page 111 ---

CHAPTER 10: Methods for Wound Closure

91

Enter one side of the wound and run the suture in the dermal layer subcutaneously through the other edge(s), exiting near the original entrance point (Fig. 10-7).

# ■ NON-SUTURE TECHNIQUES

# Staples

Staples are fast and easy to use but not as precise as other wound closure methods. Staples should not be used on the face as the cosmetic outcome is not as favorable as suture repairs. This wound closure method is excellent for scalp wound repair and other locations where cosmetic outcome is not as important. In some wounds, deep sutures may be needed to close dermal layers prior to staple application. Align the wound edges and keep the staple device perpendicular to and centered on the wound. Avoid firm downward pressure on the wound as this can cause depression of the wound edges. Instead, use gentle pressure to evert the wound edges at the time of each staple deployment (Fig. 10-8).

# Adhesive Tapes

Adhesive tapes are inexpensive, simple, painless, and rapid. They slough off when exposed to moisture and thus should only be used for low tension, fragile wounds such as skin tears. Use an adhesive adjunct such as tincture of benzoin and place the tape segments perpendicular to the wound about 3 mm apart. Reinforce with parallel strips, if needed.

# Tissue Adhesives

Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are rapid, painless, and have similar tensile strength to 4-0 poliglecaprone subcuticular sutures. They provide a moisture and infection barrier, but can come off more easily when exposed to moisture. This wound repair does not require removal after healing, as the compound  sloughs  off  spontaneously  in  5  to  10  days.  Do  not  use  this wound repair material over joints or areas of high tension. Approximate the wound well, and place a thin coat of adhesive over the wound extending 5 to 10 mm on either side, repeating once dry (Fig. 10-9). Adhesive tape can be used as an adjunct for long or complex wounds.

# Hair Apposition

Scalp wounds can be closed by hair apposition. After cleaning the wound thoroughly, twist several strands of hair together on either side. Then twist

# Lacerations to The Face and Scalp

J. Hayes Calvert

# ■ SCALP AND FOREHEAD

The scalp and forehead have thick skin and little cushioning fat (Fig. 11-1). Wounds of the scalp and forehead can usually be repaired with primary closure when they are not visibly infected, regardless of the time since the injury  and  even  if  the  injury  was  secondary  to  a  bite. After  performing wound cleansing and achieving hemostasis, palpate the base of the wound to assess for possible skull fracture. CT scan can be used to further evaluate an injury when an underlying fracture is suspected.

Examine  the  wound  edges  for  signs  of  devitalized  tissue  that  may require  debridement. When  hemostasis  is  not  easily  achieved,  use  direct pressure or vessel clamping to control bleeding at the wound edges. Irrigate the  wound  well  to  remove  contamination  and  reduce  the  risk  of  wound infection. Close scalp lacerations with surgical staples or simple interrupted sutures using nonabsorbable monofilament or rapidly absorbable material.

96

--- Page 117 ---

CHAPTER 11: Lacerations to The Face and Scalp

97

Consider  a  pressure  dressing  over  deep  scalp  lacerations  for  the  first 24 hours to reduce the chance of hematoma formation.

Superficial forehead lacerations are not associated with injury to the frontalis muscle, while deep lacerations do have damage to the frontalis muscle.  Close  superficial  forehead  lacerations  with  6-0  nonabsorbable interrupted suture, rapidly absorbable suture, or tissue adhesive. Close the muscular layer of deep forehead lacerations with buried 5-0 absorbable suture, and then close the epidermal layer with 6-0 nonabsorbable suture,  skin  closure  strips,  or  tissue  adhesive.  Eyebrows  are  important landmarks to assist with reapproximation of wound edges. When wounds involve the eyebrows, minimize skin debridement and leave suture tails long to facilitate removal. Remove scalp staples or sutures in 10 to 14 days,  while  forehead  nonabsorbable  sutures  can  be  removed  in  5  to 7 days.

# ■ EYELIDS

The  eyelids  are  thin  and  offer  limited  protection  from  injuries  to  the globe and surrounding structures. Examine lid injuries for involvement of the canthi, the lacrimal system, or penetration through the tarsal plate or lid margin (Fig. 11-2). Eyelid injuries within 6 to 8 mm of the medial canthus are at risk for canalicular laceration, particularly when associated with medial wall blow-out fractures. Consider consultation with an ophthalmologist  when  ptosis  is  present  or  for  complex  eyelid  wounds such as those involving the inner surface of the lid, lid margins, lacrimal duct, and tarsal plate. Close uncomplicated eyelid lacerations with nonabsorbable 6-0 or 7-0 simple interrupted percutaneous sutures. Avoid the use  of  tissue  adhesive  near  the  eye.  Remove  nonabsorbable  sutures  in 3 to 5 days.

--- Page 118 ---

98

SECTION 3:  Emergency Wound Management

# ■ NOSE

Examine nasal lacerations to determine depth and involvement of deep tissue  layers.  Exposed  cartilage  or  deep  involvement  of  the  tissue  layers increases the risk of infection. Topical lidocaine into the nasal cavity may provide  sufficient  anesthesia  for  some  local  wound  repair,  and  injected intradermal  lidocaine  with  or  without  epinephrine  is  appropriate  when needed to facilitate wound evaluation, cleansing, and repair.

Close  superficial  nasal  lacerations  with  6-0  nonabsorbable  monofilament simple interrupted sutures. When the laceration extends through all tissue layers, begin closure with a 5-0 nonabsorbable, monofilament suture that aligns the skin surrounding the entrances of the nasal canals to prevent malposition and notching of the alar rim. Gentle traction on the long, untied ends of this suture facilitates alignment of the mucosa and cartilage layers during  subsequent  suture  placement.  Close  the  mucosal  layer  with  5-0 rapidly  absorbable  interrupted  sutures,  and  then  irrigate  the  area  gently from  the  outside  before  completing  the  repair.  Avoid  suture  placement directly  into  the  cartilage.  Complete  the  repair  with  6-0  nonabsorbable monofilament material close to the wound edges. Percutaneous nonabsorbable sutures should be removed in 3 to 5 days.

Drain small unilateral septal hematomas with an 18G needle, or incise the hematoma if it is larger. After the hematoma has been evacuated, place an anterior nasal packing to prevent reaccumulation. Consider a course of oral antibiotics to prevent infection while nasal packing is in place.

# ■ EAR

Close superficial lacerations of the ear with 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament interrupted sutures, taking care to cover any exposed cartilage and minimize skin debridement. In most through-and-through lacerations of the ear, the skin can be approximated and the underlying cartilage will be supported  adequately  (Fig.  11-3).  After  laceration  repair  is  complete,

--- Page 119 ---

CHAPTER 11: Lacerations to The Face and Scalp

99

place a small piece of nonadherent gauze over the laceration and apply a pressure dressing to prevent development of a perichondral hematoma. To create a pressure dressing, place gauze squares behind the ear to apply pressure,  and  wrap  the  head  circumferentially  with  gauze.  Discontinue the pressure dressing after 24 hours when reevaluation demonstrates that no hematoma has accumulated. Consider consultation with an otolaryngologist  or  plastic  surgeon  for  complex  lacerations,  ear  avulsions,  or auricular  hematomas.  Remove  nonabsorbable  percutaneous  sutures  in 5 to 7 days.

# ■ LIPS

The  external  surface  of  the  lips  has  three  distinct  regions:  the  skin,  the vermilion border (junction of the skin and red portion of the lips), and the oral mucosa. Isolated intraoral lesions of the lip often do not need to be sutured, especially if they are < 1  cm in length. Repair large or gaping intraoral lip wounds with a rapidly absorbable 5-0 suture. Through-and-through lacerations of the lip that do not include the vermilion border can be closed in layers. Begin repair with 5-0 rapidly absorbable suture for the mucosal surface, then gently irrigate the wound from the outside before closing the orbicularis oris muscle with 4-0 or 5-0 absorbable suture. Finally, close the skin layer with 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament sutures in a simple interrupted fashion.

Begin closure of a complicated lip laceration at the junction between the vermilion and the skin with a 6-0 nonabsorbable, monofilament suture to precisely align the edges of the vermilion border (Fig. 11-4). After placing that first stitch, continue to repair the vermilion and skin with the same 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture and then use 5-0 rapidly absorbable suture for any needed mucosal surface repair. Consider oral antibiotics for contaminated wounds or through-and-through lacerations. Remove nonabsorbable percutaneous sutures in 5 to 7 days.

SECTION 3:  Emergency Wound Management

# ■ CHEEKS AND FACE

Evaluate cheek and other facial lacerations to determine wound depth and to  assess  for  damage  to  the  parotid  gland,  parotid  duct,  and  facial  nerve (Fig. 11-5), which would necessitate specialty consultation and operative repair.  Repair  superficial  facial  lacerations  without  underlying  complications  with  6-0  nonabsorbable  monofilament,  simple  interrupted  sutures. Tissue adhesive may also be used for wounds of appropriate size and location. Full-thickness cheek lacerations can be repaired in layers beginning with the intraoral mucosa using absorbable sutures. After irrigation of the external wound, close the subcutaneous and skin layers using 5-0 or 6-0 suture material. Remove nonabsorbable percutaneous sutures in 5 to 7 days.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

When taking a history, consider occupation, time and mechanism of injury, and  hand  dominance.  Examination  of  all  arm  and  hand  injuries  includes inspection at rest, evaluation of motor, nerve, and tendon functions, evaluation of  sensory  nerve  function,  and  assessment  of  perfusion.  Examine  active motion and resistance to passive motion. (See Tables 12-1 and 12-2.) Examine all wounds for evidence of potential artery, nerve, tendon, or bone injuries, and the possible presence of foreign bodies, debris, or bacterial contamination.

Control bleeding to achieve adequate visualization and assessment of an injury.  When  necessary,  a  manual  blood  pressure  cuff  can  be  used  as  a temporary tourniquet for proximal injuries or a penrose drain can be used for distal finger injuries, taking care to apply for only limited time periods. Once adequate visualization is  obtained,  examine  the  wound  for  foreign bodies  and  tendon  or  joint  capsule  injuries.  Examine  the  hand  and  arm throughout normal range of motion, including in the position of injury to avoid missing deep structure injuries that may have moved out of the field of view when examined in a neutral position. Obtain anteroposterior and lateral x-rays if bony injuries, retained radiopaque foreign bodies, or joint involvement are suspected.

# Lacerations to the Leg and Foot

Moira Davenport

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Lacerations  to  the  leg  and  foot  are  commonly  seen  in  the  Emergency Department. The mechanism of injury determines the likelihood of disruption to underlying tissue, the risk of a retained foreign body, and the degree of potential contamination. See Chapter 9 for additional information about evaluating and preparing wounds for repair. As with other extremity injuries, evaluating limb positioning at the time of injury and replicating this during wound evaluation may help to uncover occult tendon injuries.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Assess lower extremity wounds for any associated nerve, vessel, or tendon  injuries.  Evaluate  distal  motor  and  sensory  function  and  compare findings  from  the  injured  extremity  to  the  contralateral  side.  Sensory function is best evaluated prior to providing anesthetic agents, but a full assessment  of  motor  function  and  wound  exploration  may  be  easier  to perform after the wound is anesthetized. Evaluate the superficial peroneal nerve (foot eversion), the deep peroneal nerve (foot inversion and ankle dorsiflexion), and the tibial nerve (ankle plantar flexion). Move the limb through its full range of motion to exclude tendon injury. Test each tendon function individually and visually inspect the wound at rest and in motion to  rule  out  a  partial  laceration.  Evaluate  the  extensor  hallucis  longus (great  toe  extension  with  ankle  inversion),  tibialis  anterior  (ankle  dosiflexion  and  inversion),  and  achilles  tendon  (ankle  plantar  flexion  and inversion).

Laboratory  studies  are  not  typically  indicated  for  simple  lacerations. Consider x-rays if there is suspicion for a fracture or radiopaque foreign body. Ultrasonography may also be useful to identify a foreign body, tendon injury, or bony abnormality.

Emergency providers are often called upon to evaluate acute wounds that are at risk for embedded foreign bodies. Assessment of older wounds may also be complicated by retained foreign material that was initially unrecognized and can impact the healing process and risk of subsequent infection. Careful evaluation of wounds, radiographic imaging when indicated, and local exploration allow identification of most foreign bodies. Once identified, many foreign bodies can be removed in the emergency department, although some may be left in place or referred to appropriate specialists for delayed removal.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

While only a small percentage of lacerations and puncture wounds contain foreign bodies, carefully assess all injuries to evaluate for potentially unrecognized retained material. The mechanism of injury, composition and shape of the wounding object, and the shape and location of the wound are all factors to consider. Objects that have broken, shattered, or splintered at the time of injury may increase the risk of an embedded foreign body. Brittle materials such as thorns, spikes, or branches may penetrate deeply into tissue  before  breaking. Wood  splinters  often  fragment  when  pulled  from  a puncture wound.

Adult patients who complain of a foreign body sensation in an acute wound more than doubles the likelihood of one being present. Wounds that have healed but continue to be the source of sharp pain with movement or pressure over the site may represent a retained foreign object. Other potential signs of an unrecognized foreign body may include poor wound healing, recurrent infections, or the development of soft tissue masses.

Most  foreign  bodies  can  be  identified  through  deliberate  and  careful exploration  of  wounds  determined  to  be  at  risk.  Use  adequate  lighting, appropriate  anesthesia,  and  hemostasis  techniques  to  optimize  wound evaluation. Visually inspect all recesses of a wound, when possible, recognizing that wounds deeper than 5 mm or where the full depth cannot be visualized have a higher association with foreign bodies. Consider extending the wound margins with a scalpel to permit a more complete exploration when appropriate. Blind and gentle probing with a closed hemostat can be an effective method to identify some foreign bodies, such as glass fragments, when direct visualization is not possible.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

When a foreign body is suspected but not identified and removed during visual  inspection,  consider  radiographic  imaging  for  further  evaluation. Most foreign bodies can be seen on plain radiographs, although CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI may be indicated in some circumstances (Table 14-1). Use an underpenetrated soft tissue plain radiography technique or adjust

the  contrast  and  brightness  when  using  a  digital  system  to  increase  the likelihood of identifying a foreign body. CT scan is capable of detecting more types of materials than plain film radiography, and may be useful for thorns, spines, wood splinters, or plastic foreign bodies. Ultrasound can be useful at the bedside for directing exploration and removal of foreign bodies. It is > 90% sensitive for detecting foreign bodies larger than 4 to 5 mm taking into account the composition of the foreign body, proximity to echogenic structures, and operator experience. MRI is more accurate than the other  modalities  for  identifying  wood,  plastic,  spines,  and  thorns,  but  is often less available for emergency use.

# ■ PUNCTURE WOUNDS

Puncture wounds can be challenging to manage due to difficulty visualizing and cleaning the full depth of an injury. These injuries commonly occur to the extremities, such as on the plantar surface of the foot. Puncture wounds also include injuries caused by high-pressure injection equipment, health care associated needle-stick injuries, and some bite wounds from animals. Infections are reported in 6% to 11% of puncture wounds, with Staphylococcus aureus predominating (including methicillin-resistant S.  aureus -MRSA). Pseudomonas  aeruginosa is  the  most  common  pathogen  in post-puncture  wound osteomyelitis,  particularly  when  penetration  occurs through the sole of an athletic shoe. Post-puncture wound infections despite treatment with antibiotics suggest the possibility of a retained foreign body.

# Clinical Features

Puncture wounds treated more than 6 hours after they occur have a greater risk  of  infection. Wood,  glass,  or  plastic  materials  may  break  or  splinter when an injury occurs, increasing the chance for retained fragments within the puncture track. Patient perception of a foreign body may be useful for predicting the presence of such a contaminant or fragment.

On physical examination, assess the wound and the likelihood of injury to  structures  beneath  the  skin  by  evaluating  distal  function  of  tendons, nerves,  and  blood  vessels.  Inspect  the  wound  location,  condition  of  surrounding skin, and the potential presence of foreign matter, debris, or devitalized tissue. Signs of infection include significant pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, fluctuance, decreased range of motion, or drainage from the site.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Plain  film  radiographs  should  be  obtained  for  any  wound  suspected  of having a potential radiopaque retained foreign body (Table 15-1).

--- [TABLE DETECTED] ---
TaBle 15-1 | Indications for Imaging in Puncture Wounds

Organic  substances,  such  as  wood  or  plant  matter,  are  not  reliably detected by plan radiographs, but > 90% of radiopaque foreign bodies that are > 1  mm in diameter can be found this way. CT scan is the imaging modality to use when a retained foreign body continues to be suspected after negative plain film radiography.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment recommendations for puncture wounds are based almost entirely on anecdotal evidence and uncontrolled case series.

# ■ NEEDLE-STICK INJURIES

Needle-stick injuries in health care professionals create the most concerns about infection risk from potential exposure to hepatitis viruses or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The risk of infection after an inadvertent

--- Page 137 ---

CHAPTER 15: Puncture Wounds and Bites

117

needle stick contaminated from an infectious source has been estimated to be negligible for hepatitis A, 6% for hepatitis B, 2% for hepatitis C, and 0.3%  for  HIV.  Because  recommendations  in  this  area  are  complex  and evolving, each hospital should have a predesigned protocol developed by infectious disease specialists for the evaluation, testing, and treatment of needle-stick injuries, including hepatitis B and HIV prophylaxis.

# ■ hIGh-PRESSURE-INJECTION INJURIES

High-pressure-injection injuries may present as puncture wounds, usually to the hand or foot. These are caused by industrial equipment that forces grease, paint, or other liquids through a small nozzle under high pressure. Patients initially may have pain with minimal swelling, but these injuries can still be severe as the injected liquid spreads along fascial planes and causes a delayed inflammatory  response.  Pain  can  be  controlled  with  parenteral  analgesics while  avoiding  digital  blocks  with  local  anesthesia  as  these  can  further increase tissue pressure. An appropriate hand specialist should be consulted for consideration of early surgical debridement of these injuries.

# ■ EPINEPhRINE aUTOINJECTOR INJURIES

These  injuries  typically  occur  when  a  patient  inadvertently  injects epinephrine  into  the  hand  or  finger  while  attempting  to  treat  an  allergic reaction. Patients present with pain due to the needle stick, paresthesias, and  epinephrine-induced  vasospasm  to  the  injected  area.  In  the  case  of finger  injections,  the  entire  digit  may  be  blanched  and  cold. There  is  no clear  evidence  that  active  treatment  is  better  than  observation  alone,  so many patients can be effectively treated with supportive care. Subcutaneous phentolamine injected into the original puncture site is the one treatment consistently described that rapidly reverses digital ischemia from accidental epinephrine  injection.  A  mixture  of  0.5  mL  of  standard  phentolamine solution (5 mg/mL concentration) and 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine solution will produce a 1 mL total volume containing 2.5 mg of phentolamine that can be  subcutaneously  injected  directly  through  the  site  of  an  autoinjector puncture. Patients can be discharged home once ischemia is resolved, as relapse appears unlikely.

# ■ MaMMaLIaN BITES

# Clinical Features

Complications from bite wounds include tissue injury from the bite itself, local infections, or systemic illness. All wounds should be examined and cleaned  well  with  irrigation  and  debridement  as  necessary.  Evaluate  for underlying  injury  to  joints  or  tendons.  Patient  evaluation  should  also include assessment for the potential need for tetanus and/or rabies prophylaxis (see Chapter 94).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Bite wounds with low risks for infection can often be repaired primarily. Face or scalp wounds without devitalized tissue that have no underlying fractures  can  be  candidates  for  primary  closure  in  patients  with  normal

--- Page 138 ---

118 SECTION 3: Emergency Wound Management

immune systems and wound healing properties. Delayed primary closure can be considered for wounds at higher risk of infection.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ INFECTIONS FROM CaT aND DOG BITES

# Clinical Features

Most dog bite wounds are superficial and have a relatively low risk (5%) of infection. Cat bites tend to be deeper puncture wounds and are reported to become infected in up to 80% of patients who present for emergency care. However, the true rate of infection is likely much lower than this because most patients with cat bites do not present for care unless the bite appears severe or already has signs of infection.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Despite a lack of evidence that antibiotics are effective for reducing the rates of infection after dog or cat bites, prophylactic antibiotics are often suggested for treatment of higher risk uninfected wounds. Many clinicians recommend  antibiotics  for  cat  bites,  bites  in  immunocompromised patients, deep dog bite puncture wounds, hand wounds, or wounds needing debridement.

# ■ hUMaN BITES

Human  bite  wounds  are  at  higher  risk  for  polymicrobial  infection  with staphylococcal and streptococcal species or Eikenella corrodens . Treatment with  prophylactic  amoxicillin-clavulanate  is  recommended  and  typically suture repair is not advised with the possible exception of facial wounds. Infections requiring parenteral antibiotics can be treated with ampicillinsulbactam, cefoxitin, or piperacillin-tazobactam.

# ■ RODENTS, LIVESTOCK, aND EXOTIC aND WILD aNIMaLS

Rodent bites are typically trivial, rodents are not known to carry rabies, and these bites have a low risk for infection. Most patients can be treated conservatively with standard wound care. Livestock and large game animals can cause serious injury with a significant risk of infection and systemic illness caused by brucellosis, leptospirosis, or tularemia (see Chapters 97 and 98). Aggressive wound care and broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics are recommended.

# Postrepair Wound Care

Eugenia B. Quackenbush

After an acute wound is repaired, focus subsequent wound care to optimize healing and prevent complications. Issues to consider include the appropriate use of dressings, efforts to minimize edema, prophylactic antibiotics, tetanus prophylaxis, cleansing, and use of packing or drains. Provide patients with appropriate pain control, follow-up instructions, and patient education.

# ■ USE OF DRESSINGS

Wound dressings provide a moist environment to promote epithelialization and  speed  healing.  Cover  appropriate  sutured  or  stapled  wounds  with  a protective, nonadherent dressing for 24 to 48 hours. Semipermeable films such as OpSite ®  are available as an alternative to conventional gauze dressings, although one of the disadvantages of these newer materials is their inability to absorb large amounts of fluid. As an alternative to traditional dressings, topical antibiotics may be used to facilitate a warm, moist environment to promote initial wound healing and may help to prevent scab formation. Wounds closed with tissue adhesives should not be treated with topical  antibiotic  ointment  because  it  will  loosen  the  adhesive  and  may result in wound dehiscence.

# ■ PATIENT POSITIONING AFTER WOUND REPAIR

Recommend  elevation  of  the  injured  body  part,  if  possible,  to  reduce edema around the wound and facilitate healing. Splints can be useful for extremity injuries as they decrease motion across the wound and may help limit movement-associated discomfort or the development of additional edema.  Pressure  dressings  can  be  used  in  some  circumstances  to  help minimize  the  accumulation  of  fluid  and  are  useful  for  ear  and  scalp lacerations (see Chapter 11).

# ■ PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS

Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely recommended for all wounds, but instead should be reserved for selected special circumstances. When deciding  whether  or  not  to  prescribe  antibiotics,  consider  the  mechanism  of injury, location of the wound, degree of any bacterial or soil contamination, and host factors that may predispose to infection.

Prophylactic antibiotics are often recommended for human bites, dog or cat bites on the extremities (see Chapter 15), open fractures, and wounds with  exposed  joints  or  tendons  (see  Chapters  12  and  13).  Patients  with wounds  in  areas  with  lymphedema  may  also  benefit  from  prophylactic antibiotics. When indicated, a 3- to 5-day course of antibiotics is adequate for nonbite injuries and a 5- to 7-day course is adequate for bite wounds. See  Table  16-1  for  recommended  antibiotic  regimens  for  those  special circumstances when antibiotics may be indicated. Patients at high risk for infection should be advised to return for a wound check in 24 to 48 hours.

# ■ TETANUS PROPHYLAXIS

Evaluate patients to determine whether tetanus prophylaxis will be recommended. Inquire about the mechanism of injury, age of the wound, and the patient's tetanus immunization status.

# ■ WOUND CLEANSING

Wounds that have been repaired with sutures or staples may be cleansed as early as 8 hours after closure without increasing the risk of wound infection. Clean the wound area with soap and water and examine for signs of infection daily. Application of topical antibiotics for the first 3 to 5 days may decrease scab formation and help to prevent wound edge separation. Patients with wounds closed with tissue adhesives may shower, but should not completely immerse the wound or apply topical antibiotics, as this will loosen the adhesive bond and cause earlier sloughing of the adhesive.

# ■ WOUND DRAINS

Drains  or  wound  packing  may  be  placed  in  healing  wounds  to  remove interstitial  fluid  or  blood,  keep  an  open  tract  for  drainage  of  infectious material, or to prevent an abscess from forming by allowing drainage from a  contaminated  area.  Ribbon  gauze  packing  is  often  used  to  pack  an abscess cavity after incision and drainage, and can be changed regularly as long  as  the  wound  continues  to  drain.  Closed  drainage  systems  have largely  replaced  open  wound drains placed after surgical procedures, as closed systems prevent secondary bacterial contamination into the wound. Provide  appropriate  follow-up  instructions  for  patients  with  drains  or packing in place.

# ■ PAIN CONTROL

Educate patients about the expected degree of pain associated with a wound and the measures they can take to reduce that pain. Splints may help to reduce pain and swelling in significant extremity lacerations. Analgesics may be needed for a short time period, although narcotic analgesia is rarely necessary after the first 48 hours of healing for most wounds.

# ■ FOLLOW-UP

Provide  instructions  for  regular  wound  examination  during  the  healing process  and  when  to  return  for  suture  or  staple  removal.  Recommend reevaluation in 24 to 48 hours for patients with high-risk wounds or comorbidities that may impair successful wound healing. Facial sutures are typically removed in 3 to 5 days, while sutures in most other areas of the body can be removed after 7 to 10 days of healing. Sutures in some locations such as the hands, feet, buttocks, or over joints should remain in place for 10  to  14  days  to  reduce  the  chance  of  wound  dehiscence  after  suture removal.

When removing sutures or adhesive tapes, take care to avoid tension perpendicular to  the  wound  that  could  cause  dehiscence. When  needed, gently debride scab or crusting over each suture with hydrogen peroxidesoaked gauze. Grasp the suture knot with forceps and use scissors or an appropriate scalpel blade to cut the suture. Remove skin staples with an appropriate device that deforms the center and extracts the legs from the skin. For wounds closed with tissue adhesive, advise patients to avoid rubbing, picking, scrubbing, or exposing the area to water for more than brief periods of time during the healing process. Tissue adhesive will slough off

--- Page 144 ---

124 SECTION 3: Emergency Wound Management

itself  over  time,  typically  within  5  to  10  days  of  application,  as  wound healing progresses.

# ■ PATIENT EDUCATION ABOUT LONG-TERM COSMETIC OUTCOME

Inform patients that all traumatic lacerations result in some degree of tissue scarring and that the short-term cosmetic appearance may not be predictive of the ultimate cosmetic outcome. Instruct patients to avoid sun exposure while wounds are healing, as wounds exposed to the sun can develop permanent hyperpigmentation. Patients should wear sunblock for at least 6 to 12 months after injury to optimize the cosmetic outcome.

# Cardiovascular Diseases

# Chest Pain: Cardiac or Not

Andrew Nyce

Millions  of  patients  present  to  emergency  departments  (EDs)  each  year with acute nontraumatic chest pain. Varied clinical presentations coupled with a wide differential diagnosis make patients with chest pain some of the most  challenging  cared  for  by  emergency  care  providers.  An  organized approach  will  assist  clinicians  when  differentiating  acute  coronary  syndrome (ACS) from other causes of chest pain.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Classically described cardiac chest pain is retrosternal in the left anterior chest  with  crushing,  tightness,  squeezing,  or  pressure  that  is  often brought on by exertion and relieved with rest. Patients may also complain of dyspnea, diaphoresis, and nausea with pain radiating to the left shoulder, jaw, arm, or hand. Some patients, such as premenopausal and early  menopausal  women,  racial  minorities,  diabetics,  the  elderly,  and patients with psychiatric disease or altered mental status, may have nonclassic  presentations  of ACS  that  may  or  may  not  be  associated  with chest pain. Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who present without  chest  pain  have  diagnostic  and  treatment  delays  and  a  higher mortality rate compared to AMI patients who do have chest pain. The onset of symptoms attributed to cardiac disease may be sudden or gradual, and traditionally angina pain lasts 2 to 10 minutes, unstable angina lasts 10 to 30 minutes, and AMI pain often lasts longer than 30 minutes. Dyspnea at rest or with exertion, nausea, light-headedness, generalized weakness, acute changes in mental status, diaphoresis, or shoulder, arm, or  jaw  discomfort  may  be  the  only  presenting  symptoms  for ACS  for some patients.

Cardiac risk factors are useful in predicting coronary artery disease in patient populations but may be less useful when applied to an individual patient.  Cocaine  abuse  and  HIV  infection  can  accelerate  atherosclerosis. Classic symptoms such as radiation of pain to the arms, an exertional component,  associated  diaphoresis,  nausea,  and  vomiting  increase  the  likelihood that a patient is suffering from an AMI while other symptoms such as pain  that  is  pleuritic  in  nature,  positional,  sharp  and  reproducible  with

126 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

palpation/positioning  decrease  the  likelihood  of  disease.  Unfortunately, there is no identifiable symptom complex that definitively rules in or out the disease without objective testing.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Patients with ACS often have a normal physical exam but may present with abnormal vital signs. Tachycardia may result from increased sympathetic tone and decreased left ventricular stroke volume. Bradycardia may result from  ischemia  to  the  conduction  system.  The  degree  of  hemodynamic instability is dependent on the amount of myocardium at risk, associated dysrhythmias, or preexisting valvular or myocardial dysfunction. Patients with acute ischemia may have a third or fourth heart sound from changes in ventricular compliance, a new murmur from ruptured cordae tendineae or an aortic root dissection, or crackles on lung auscultation from congestive  heart  failure.  Chest  wall  tenderness  has  been  demonstrated  in  up  to 15%  of  patients  with  AMI,  making  this  physical  examination  finding unlikely to be useful by itself to completely exclude the possibility of ACS. Response to a particular treatment such as nitroglycerin or a 'gastrointestinal  (GI)  cocktail'  poorly  discriminates  between  cardiac  and  noncardiac chest pain in isolation.

A detailed history and physical exam allows an emergency provider to risk stratify serious pathology in the differential diagnosis of a chest pain patient. Focused diagnostic testing should be performed based on the likelihood  of  serious  pathology.  When  history  and  exam  make ACS  a  likely potential  cause,  initial  testing  commonly  includes  an  electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and cardiac biomarkers.

# Electrocardiography

Guidelines recommend ECG screening within 10 minutes of ED arrival for patients with chest pain of potential cardiac etiology. A normal ECG lacks  the  sensitivity  to  exclude ACS  in  isolation;  notably  patients  with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation MI may have nonspecific or normal ECG tracings. ECGs demonstrating new ST-segment elevations ≥ 1 mm in two contiguous leads represent acute MI that will benefit from rapid  reperfusion  interventions.  New  ST-segment  elevations,  Q  waves, left  bundle  branch  block,  and  T-wave  inversions  or  normalizations  in symptomatic patients  are  suggestive  of  ischemia  and  should  be  further investigated. Misinterpretation of ECGs occurs in up to 40% of missed AMI cases, and the diagnostic value of an ECG can be improved by comparing it to a prior ECG and/or repeating it during the patient evaluation process.

# Imaging

Chest  radiography  is  commonly  performed  for  patients  with  chest  pain. Patients with ACS will most often have a normal chest x-ray, but images are useful to evaluate for other diagnostic possibilities such as thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, pneumonia or pneumothorax. Chest CT may be useful to diagnose other possible conditions such as pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

--- Page 147 ---

CHAPTER 17: Chest Pain: Cardiac or Not

127

# Serum Markers

Due to its high sensitivity and nearly complete cardiac specificity, cardiac troponin (cTn) is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury.  Serum  cTn  should  be  obtained  in  patients  with  suspected  ACS. While other clinical conditions such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, acute CHF, aortic valve disease, and cardiac procedures can also be associated with an elevated troponin level, acute myocardial ischemia can be differentiated from nonischemic troponin elevations based on the pattern of  elevation  and  the  clinical  context.  With  contemporary  assays,  cTn  is detected as early as 2 hours after symptom onset in AMI patients but may not be reliably elevated until 6 hours after symptoms. Elevations peak at 48 hours from symptom onset and may remain elevated for 10 days. Patients with early presentation (within 6 hours of symptom onset) or those with intermittent symptoms should have serial measurements over time. A single cTn may be sufficient to exclude AMI for constant symptoms > 8  to  12 hours. The measurement of cTn at short time intervals (delta cTn) is more sensitive for AMI than a single cTn. Patients with renal failure often have elevation of cTn and comparing baseline measures can assist the provider in  risk  stratifying  the  patient. Although  almost  obsolete,  creatine  kinaseMB testing may be useful in a subset of patients in whom the timing of infarction remains unclear.

# Differential Diagnosis

Common causes of chest pain are listed in Table 17-1.

The classic symptoms of life-threatening causes of acute chest pain are listed in Table 17-2.

# Pulmonary Embolism

Patients with pulmonary embolism often complain of sudden onset pleuritic chest pain associated with dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, or hypoxemia. Risk factors include prolonged immobilization, active cancer, recent surgery or trauma, procoagulant syndromes, exogenous estrogen, or previous thromboembolic  disease.  Clinical  decision  aids  such  as  the  Wells  and  Revised Geneva Scores and the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) can help risk stratify patients for diagnostic evaluation. Serum D-dimer may be a useful test in low-risk patients to help determine which patients need further

testing  with  CT  pulmonary  angiography  to  identify  pulmonary  embolism. For more details, see Chapter 25, 'Thromboembolism.'

# Aortic Dissection

Patients with aortic dissection classically describe a sudden onset of severe, tearing pain radiating to the intrascapular area of the back. Secondary symptoms result from arterial branch occlusions and may include ischemic stroke, AMI, or limb ischemia. Risk factors include male sex, age > 50, uncontrolled hypertension, connective tissue disorders, cocaine use, bicuspid valve or aortic valve replacement, and pregnancy. Physical exam findings may include unilateral pulse deficits or focal neurologic deficits. If aortic dissection is suspected, obtain a CT aortogram or transesophageal echocardiogram. A normal chest x-ray and negative D-dimer lowers the probability but does not completely exclude the diagnosis of an aortic dissection. Additionally, this diagnosis can be associated with nonspecific ST segment or T-wave changes on ECG testing. For more details see Chapter 27, 'Aortic Dissection and Aneurysms.'

# Esophageal Rupture (Boerhaave's Syndrome)

Patients  with  esophageal  rupture  often  present  with  sudden-onset,  sharp substernal chest pain that follows an episode of forceful vomiting. Patients are usually ill appearing with tachycardia, fever, dyspnea, and diaphoresis.

--- Page 149 ---

CHAPTER 17: Chest Pain: Cardiac or Not

129

Physical examination may reveal crepitus in the neck or chest from subcutaneous emphysema, while audible crepitus on cardiac auscultation (Hamman's crunch) is a rare finding. A chest x-ray may be normal or demonstrate a  pleural  effusion  (left  more  common),  pneumothorax,  pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, or subcutaneous air. Diagnosis is made via CT of chest  with  oral  water-soluble  contrast.  For  more  details  see  Chapter  40, 'Esophageal Emergencies.'

# Spontaneous Pneumothorax

A spontaneous pneumothorax causes sudden-onset, sharp, pleuritic chest pain with dyspnea. These classically occur in tall, slender male patients and risk factors include smoking, COPD, and asthma. Physical exam findings are inconsistent but auscultation may reveal decreased breath sounds on the affected side. The diagnosis is made by chest x-ray with only a small percentage  of  patients  progressing  to  develop  a  tension  pneumothorax.  See more details in Chapter 32, 'Spontaneous and Iatrogenic Pneumothorax.'

# Acute Pericarditis

Pain  from  acute  pericarditis  is  typically  sharp,  severe,  constant,  and retrosternal that radiates to the back, neck, or jaw. Pain is classically worsened by lying supine and is relieved by sitting forward. The presence of a pericardial friction rub supports the diagnosis. ECG may show PR-segment depressions, diffuse ST-segment elevations, or T-wave inversions that are typically diffuse. See more details in Chapter 24, 'The Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis, and Pericardial Disease.'

# Musculoskeletal Causes

Chest pain due to irritation or inflammation of structures in the chest wall is commonly seen in the ED. Possible causes include costochondritis, xiphodynia  (inflammation  of  the  xiphoid  process),  precordial  catch  syndrome, intercostal strain due to coughing, and pectoralis muscle strain in the setting of recent physical exertion. Patients often complain of sharp pain that is worsened with movement of the chest wall and palpation. While chest wall tenderness is also present in some patients with ACS or other significant disease processes, a clear musculoskeletal etiology with completely reproducible pain in a patient without other symptoms or risk factors support this diagnosis.

# Gastrointestinal Causes

Gastrointestinal disorders such as esophageal reflux, dyspepsia syndromes, and esophageal motility disorders often cannot be reliably differentiated from ACS by history and physical exam alone. Symptoms can range from a gnawing or burning pain in the lower chest with gastritis to postprandial dull, boring pain in the epigastric region with peptic ulcer disease. Esophageal spasm is often associated with reflux disease and is characterized by a sudden onset of dull or tight substernal chest pain. The pain is typically precipitated by drinking cold liquids and can be relieved by nitroglycerin. Clinicians should determine whether the symptoms are due to a GI disorder based on the clinical presentation and the absence of findings and/or risk factors suggesting an ischemic cause. Diagnostic decisions should not be made solely on the basis of a response to a therapeutic trial of antacids,

# Acute Coronary Syndromes: Myocardial Infarction and Unstable Angina

Maame Yaa A. B. Yiadom

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) encompass a spectrum of cardiac disorders  with  myocardial  ischemia  and/or  injury. These  include  ST-elevation myocardial  infarction  (STEMI),  non-STEMI  (NSTEMI),  and  unstable angina.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Chest pain is the most common symptom for patients with ACS. Important elements of the history include the timing of symptom onset, location, quality, severity, and duration. Also important is whether the pain is intermittent, constant, or waxing and waning. Twenty percent to 30% of all patients diagnosed with ACS report atypical symptoms, and their chief complaint  may  not  include  chest  pain.  These  atypical  symptoms  can include  shortness  of  breath,  nausea,  diaphoresis,  back  pain,  abdominal pain,  dizziness,  or  palpitations.  Clinical  features  associated  with  chest pain that is diagnosed as ACS include substernal or left-sided chest pain, radiation of pain to one or both arms, and chest pain accompanied with nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.

Discuss risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) with patients to stratify the risk of ACS. These risk factors include older age, male gender, family history, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Patients with a long history of cocaine use may be at risk for accelerated CAD development, and recent use can cause acute ischemia from coronary vasospasm. The presence or absence of risk factors alone are poorly predictive of the likelihood of myocardial infarction in a patient presenting with acute symptoms. Physical examination can help identify signs of hemodynamic dysfunction from cardiac strain or acute heart failure such as pallor, diaphoresis,  altered  mental  status,  elevated  jugular  venous  distension, peripheral edema, or rales on pulmonary exam.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Consider  alternative  diagnoses  for  patient  symptoms  based  on  clinical assessment,  which  may  include  diseases  such  as  pulmonary  embolism, congestive  heart  failure,  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  symptomatic hiatal hernia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia, pneumothorax,  pericarditis,  myocarditis,  aortic  dissection,  chest  trauma, chest wall disorders, or mediastinal disorders.

Promptly obtain an ECG to assess for signs of cardiac ischemia. Findings diagnostic for STEMI include at least one of the four criteria listed in Table 18-1.

In the setting of symptoms suggestive of ischemia, ECG findings consistent with STEMI should be acted upon promptly to initiate appropriate

therapy. ECG findings that do not meet criteria for STEMI but raise concerns for NSTEMI or unstable angina may include ST or T wave changes in a coronary artery distribution (see Table 18-2).

For patients with suspected ACS, obtain serum troponin, chest radiograph,  CBC,  electrolytes,  and  PT/PTT.  NSTEMI  is  diagnosed  when  an elevated serum troponin is identified in a patient with symptoms consistent with  myocardial  ischemia.  Consider  repeating  troponin  levels  within 3  hours  when  diagnostic  uncertainty  remains.  Over  time,  a  patient  may progress in disease severity, prompting consideration for serial ECGs to identify  any  dynamic  ischemic  changes,  bedside  echocardiography  to assess  for  cardiac  wall  motion  abnormalities,  and/or  additional  serum troponin testing. Consult with cardiology to determine whether early cardiac  catheterization  may  be  appropriate  for  patients  with  NSTEMI  who continue to have concerning symptoms or dynamic changes.

Unstable  angina  is  a  clinical  diagnosis  based  on  history,  physical examination findings, and diagnostic testing that does not reveal a STEMI or NSTEMI. This may precede STEMI or NSTEMI or may be the presenting  diagnosis  that  leads  to  a  new  diagnosis  of  CAD.  Unstable  angina characteristically  presents  with  chest  pain  (or  atypical  ACS  symptoms) associated  with  evidence  of  obstructive  coronary  artery  disease  and  has one  of  the  following  three  characteristics:  (1)  began  within  the  past  2 months;  (2)  has  increasing  frequency,  intensity,  or  duration  of  existing angina symptoms; or (3) existing angina begins to occur at rest. Additional diagnostic testing that may be helpful when unstable angina is considered includes  coronary  CT  angiogram,  exercise  treadmill  testing,  cardiac nuclear perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI.

Cardiogenic shock occurs when there is insufficient cardiac output to meet the metabolic demands of the tissues. It is most commonly caused by an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with extensive cardiac tissue damage, impaired right ventricular cardiac contractility, or subsequent rupture of a papillary muscle. Other potential causes of cardiogenic shock include cardiotoxic drug effects, infection such as myopericarditis or endocarditis, and mechanical  cardiac  dysfunction  caused  by  valvular  disease,  pulmonary embolism,  cardiac  tamponade,  or  myocardial  contusion.  Early  treatment and stabilization of patients suffering from cardiogenic shock are important, as mortality approaches 50% for an AMI that is complicated by cardiogenic shock.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

A hallmark of all types of shock is tissue hypoperfusion and the resulting end-organ  manifestations  of  this  lack  of  adequate  blood  supply.  Cardiogenic shock generally presents with hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 90 mm Hg), although SBP may be greater than 90 mm Hg in some patients  such  as  those  with  preexisting  and  uncontrolled  hypertension. Sinus tachycardia is frequently seen, but may be absent particularly when patients are taking medications that can inhibit an appropriate tachycardic response, such as β -blockers. Evidence of end-organ tissue hypoperfusion in cardiogenic shock may include cool or mottled skin, oliguria, or altered mental status. Left ventricular failure can present with findings concerning for acute pulmonary edema, such as tachypnea, rales, wheezing, and frothy sputum.  Patients  with  hypotension  who  have  jugular  venous  distention without pulmonary edema may be suffering from right ventricular failure due to infarction, cardiac tamponade, or pulmonary embolism. The presence of a new heart murmur on cardiac auscultation may represent a ventricular septal defect or an acute valvular dysfunction from papillary muscle dysfunction  or  chordae  tendineae  rupture  that  can  manifest  clinically  as cardiogenic shock.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Once the diagnosis of shock has been made, a key task for the clinician is to differentiate cardiogenic shock from shock that is caused by other disease processes, such as hypovolemia, overwhelming sepsis, or neurogenic shock.  Evaluation  of  a  hypotensive  patient  for  signs  of  gastrointestinal bleeding, severe dehydration, potential sources of significant infection, or the presence of new neurologic deficits may help to establish an alternate diagnosis.

When cardiogenic shock is suspected, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is appropriate to assist in the detection of acute cardiac ischemia or infarction,

138

--- Page 159 ---

CHAPTER 19: Cardiogenic Shock

139

arrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or signs of drug toxicity with cardiac manifestations. ST-segment depression in the lateral leads of the ECG may be suggestive of a right ventricular infarction, which is associated with increased mortality and may not manifest itself with ST-segment elevation in a standard twelve lead ECG. Look for pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum, enlarged cardiac silhouette, or other alternative diagnoses such as pneumonia or pneumothorax on chest radiograph.

Bedside echocardiography, while not a substitute for emergent formal transthoracic  echocardiography  when  clinically  indicated,  can  rapidly exclude other causes of hypotension, identify some mechanical precipitants of shock, and help guide therapy. Visualization of the inferior cava can help to determine volume status when considering hypovolemic shock. A pericardial effusion can be diagnosed using limited bedside echocardiography and along with findings such as diastolic collapse of the right atrium and ventricle can be diagnostic for cardiac tamponade. Left ventricular function and cardiac contractility can also be evaluated with bedside testing and may support  the  clinician's  impression  of  cardiogenic  shock  when  decreased from normal cardiac function.

There  is  no  single  laboratory  test  that  is  diagnostic  for  cardiogenic shock.  Obtain  a  complete  blood  count  and  chemistries  (including  liver function  tests)  to  evaluate  for  anemia,  potential  signs  of  infection,  and some components of end organ dysfunction. In the absence of ST-segment elevation that is diagnostic for an acute MI, elevations of cardiac markers such as troponin can establish the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). In addition, these markers may add prognostic value in patients with other causes of shock such as acute heart failure and sepsis.  Given  their  high  negative  predictive  value,  natriuretic  peptides, such as cardiac BNP or n-terminal pro-BNP, suggest a noncardiac etiology of patient condition if normal. In the setting of shock, serum lactate levels indicate the degree of hypoperfusion present and may be useful to follow during resuscitative efforts. Blood gas measurements will provide insight  into  acid-base  status  and  CO 2 retention.  Specialized  laboratory testing,  such  as  toxicology  studies,  should  be  guided  by  the  specific clinical situation.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

Airway management when necessary, circulatory stabilization, and arrangements for definitive cardiac care often occur simultaneously for patients in cardiogenic  shock.  Cardiology  and/or  cardiothoracic  surgery  should  be consulted early when cardiogenic shock is diagnosed, as emergent coronary revascularization is an important intervention when ischemia is the underlying  cause.  Transfer  to  a  facility  with  such  specialized  care  should  be arranged when indicated.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain or other  symptoms  suggesting  possible  coronary  ischemia  should  be  riskstratified based on the probability of having an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients with a low-probability ACS have no objective evidence of acute coronary ischemia or infarction. These patients do not have characteristic  ST-segment  elevation  or  depression  on  an  electrocardiogram (ECG), and initial cardiac biomarkers are not elevated.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

After performing an initial history and physical examination, an emergency provider needs to determine how much of a diagnostic evaluation to undertake for a patient presenting with chest pain. Approximately 3% to 6% of patients with an initial diagnosis of noncardiac chest pain or another alternative  diagnosis  may  later  develop  a  short-term  adverse  cardiac  event, making risk stratification an important aspect of clinical decision making.

Among patients who are assessed as low-probability for ACS, aspects that have been shown to be associated with a low-risk profile include chest pain that is described as pleuritic, positional, sharp, stabbing, or that is found to be reproducible. High-risk historical features include chest pain that radiates to the arm or shoulders, is exertional, described as pressure, is accompanied by nausea or diaphoresis, or is similar to prior cardiac pain. However, even patients who present with atypical features may have some risk, and the absence of high-risk features alone cannot completely exclude the possibility of ACS. Significant coronary artery disease is rare in patients < 30 years old, although age alone does not completely eliminate ACS as a cause of acute chest pain. In addition, treatment responsiveness to nitrates, antacids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications cannot reliably confirm or exclude ACS. Focus the initial evaluation to identify potential alternative diagnoses and detect findings that may be consistent with heart failure or other underlying conditions.

The results and timing of previous cardiac testing, such as ECG, stress test, and cardiac catheterization, can be helpful to consider when determining the appropriate evaluation for possible ACS. For example, new ECG changes consistent with cardiac ischemia offer strong evidence of underlying  cardiac  disease.  Conversely,  a  recent  negative  cardiac  catheterization with no coronary luminal irregularities is associated with a very low incidence  of  myocardial  infarction  or ACS  within  a  2-year  period.  Previous stress  test  results  can  add  evidence  to  the  clinician's  diagnostic  decision making, but cannot confirm the presence or absence of disease.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The evaluation of patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS can be conceptualized  into  primary  and  secondary  assessments  (see  Fig.  20-1). The goal of the primary evaluation is to identify patients with definite ACS

141

--- Page 162 ---

142

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

and differentiate them from those with probable or possible ACS. Identifying patients with alternative causes of chest pain that are unlikely to be ACS should also be considered (see Chapter 17).

The  primary  evaluation  for  patients  with  suspected  ACS  includes  a detailed  history,  physical  examination,  ECG,  chest  radiography  as  indicated, and cardiac biomarkers. Serial ECGs can be helpful in further evaluating  patients  with  ongoing  symptoms  or  changes  in  condition.  Data obtained from this primary survey should be used to further risk-stratify patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS. Some experts have determined that when the pretest probability of ACS is ≤ 2% further testing is not indicated, whereas others have suggested a threshold of < 1% to determine when additional testing is unnecessary.

Upon completion of the primary evaluation, classify patients into one of the following categories of the prognosis-based classification system: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), probable acute ischemia, possible acute ischemia, or definitely not ischemia (see Table 20-1). Patients with probable or possible  acute  ischemia  can  be  further  stratified  based  on  their  risk  for adverse events using scoring systems such as the TIMI risk score or the HEART pathway based on clinical features, ECG findings, and initial diagnostic testing results. These scoring systems can assist clinicians in determining the extent of additional testing that is recommended.

The secondary assessment can be conducted in an ED, a hospital-based observation unit, or in the inpatient setting. The specific components of this secondary  evaluation  is  informed  by  appropriate  risk  stratification.  The goal  of  this  assessment  should  be  to  exclude  both  components  of ACS: myocardial infarction and unstable angina. In the absence of ST-segment elevation on the ECG, a myocardial infarction is excluded through the use of serial troponin measurements to detect myocardial necrosis. Serum troponin  levels  can  take  as  long  as  8  hours  from  the  time  of  infarction  to

become elevated. Therefore, using cardiac biomarkers to diagnose a myocardial infarction in the absence of dynamic ECG changes should take into account the time from symptom onset and generally include multiple measurements.  A  modified  approach  in  appropriate  low-risk  patients  is  to obtain two troponin measurements, at least 2 hours apart with one measurement at least 6 hours after the onset of pain.

Normal serial cardiac biomarker measurements reduce the likelihood of AMI but do not exclude unstable angina. Patients with a continued suspicion  for  ACS  despite  negative  biomarkers  often  undergo  some  form  of advanced cardiac testing. Common modalities of advanced cardiac testing include exercise or pharmacologically induced ECG stress test, stress echocardiography,  nuclear  imaging,  cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging

(MRI), computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), or cardiac catheterization.  Based  on  risk  stratification  and  institutional  resources, some patients will undergo this type of testing during the initial hospitalization. However, additional testing as an outpatient is an option for low-risk patients in whom AMI has been excluded.

The use of advanced cardiac testing should be guided by general principles  discussed  below  along  with  available  resources  and  institutional practice patterns:

The evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected ACS is typically initiated prior to either confirmation or exclusion of this condition. If an alternative diagnosis is confirmed and ACS is excluded, treatment should begin for the alternative diagnosis. Treat patients with suspected ACS as follows:

Syncope accounts for up to 2% of all emergency department (ED) visits and 6% of hospital admissions. Syncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness accompanied by loss of postural tone, followed by complete resolution without intervention. Although syncope often is a benign vasovagal event, it may represent a life-threatening dysrhythmia or other condition, particularly in the elderly. Near-syncope, or feeling an impending loss of consciousness without syncope, may carry the same risk as syncope.  In  up  to  half  of  syncope  cases  presenting  to  the  ED,  there  is  no definite etiology established for the syncopal episode.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Cardiac-related syncope can be due to a structural cardiac lesion that limits the  heart's  ability  to  appropriately  increase  cardiac  output.  Examples  of structural cardiac disease that can cause syncope include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction.  Tachydysrhythmias  such  as  ventricular  tachycardia,  torsades  des pointes, and supraventricular tachycardia are common causes of syncope, but bradycardic syndromes may cause it as well. Syncope from a dysrhythmia is typically sudden and without prodrome. In young people, familial dysrhythmias such as Brugada or QT syndromes are uncommon but potentially serious causes of syncope.

Syncope is most commonly caused by vasovagal reflexes. Inappropriate vagal or sympathetic tone may lead to bradycardia, hypotension, or both. The hallmark of vasovagal syncope is a slow progressive prodrome of dizziness,  nausea,  pallor,  diaphoresis,  and  diminished  vision.  The  history should include a search for possible stimuli that are known to be associated with vasovagal syncope, such as phlebotomy, prolonged standing in a warm place,  or  fear.  In  situational  syncope,  the  autonomic  reflexive  response results from a specific physical stimulus such as micturition, defecation, or extreme coughing. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is another type of reflexmediated  syncope  that  is  suggested  by  a  history  of  presyncope  when shaving, head-turning, or wearing of a constricting collar. This should be considered as a potential cause in elderly patients with recurrent syncope despite a negative cardiac workup.

Orthostatic  syncope  occurs  when  a  sudden  change  in  posture  after recumbence  is  associated  with  inadequate  compensatory  increases  in heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance. Orthostatic syncope can be due to decreased intravascular volume or poor vascular tone, which has a myriad of potential causes such as peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or medication side-effects. Since orthostatic changes can also be associated  with  other  serious  illnesses,  alternative  causes  of  syncope should still be considered even in the presence of orthostatic changes in blood pressure.

146

--- Page 167 ---

CHAPTER 21: Syncope

147

Neurologic syncope is rarely the primary cause of syncopal episodes, as patients with loss of consciousness with persistent neurological deficits or altered mental status do not meet the usual diagnostic criteria for syncope.  When  brainstem  ischemia  or  vertebrobasilar  insufficiency  is  the cause  of  syncope,  patients  will  often  report  other  posterior  circulation deficits  such  as  diplopia,  vertigo,  focal  neurological  deficits,  or  nausea associated with the syncopal episode. If patients report that upper extremity exercise preceded the event, there may be intermittent obstruction of the  brachiocephalic  or  subclavian  artery  such  as  subclavian  steal  syndrome. Subarachnoid hemorrhage may also present with syncope, but it is usually accompanied by persistent symptoms such as headache. A traumatic  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  can  also  occur  as  a  result  of  injuries associated with syncope from another cause. Seizure is the most common disorder  mistaken  for  syncope.  Brief  tonic-clonic  movements  are  often seen  with  syncope,  but  the  presence  of  a  postictal  state,  tongue  biting, incontinence, or an epileptic aura can point toward seizure as a more likely alternative diagnosis.

Medication-induced syncope can be a common complication of pharmacotherapy. Because of poor autonomic responses and multiple medications, the elderly are particularly prone to syncope as a side effect of medication use. Cardiovascular responses to orthostatic or vasodilatory challenges may be blunted by antihypertensive agents such as β -blockers and calcium channel  antagonists.  Cardiovascular  medications  may  also  cause  conduction abnormalities or life-threatening dysrhythmias. Diuretics also contribute to the risk of orthostatic hypotension due to their volume-depleting effect.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Although an etiology for a syncopal episode may be difficult to establish, the most important components of the syncope workup are a comprehensive history,  physical  examination,  and  ECG.  From  there,  risk  stratification  is  a practical  approach.  The  history  should  be  directed  to  high-risk  factors, including age, medications, and prodromal associations. Sudden events that occur without warning suggest dysrhythmias, while preceding exertion may imply  a  structural  cardiopulmonary  lesion.  Associated  symptoms  such  as palpitations or chest pains may suggest an underlying cardiac etiology, while vertigo  or  focal  weakness  can  point  toward  a  neurologic  cause.  Back  or abdominal pain may suggest a leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm or ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the appropriate patient populations. Single-vehicle crashes or trauma in the absence of defensive injuries may prompt a consideration of syncope as a precipitating event. The medical history is useful in revealing likely cardiac or psychiatric causes for syncope. When present, a family history of cardiac disease or sudden death may also be informative.

Physical  examination  may  occasionally  reveal  the  cause  of  syncope. The cardiac examination may uncover a ventricular flow obstruction or a cardiac murmur suggestive of aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Consider obtaining orthostatic vital sign measurements, as orthostatic hypotension with a systolic blood pressure drop of at least 20 mm Hg upon standing may support a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. A significant blood pressure  differential  between  upper  extremities  ( > 20  mm  Hg)  suggests

--- Page 168 ---

148

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

subclavian steal  syndrome as a possible etiology. In appropriate circumstances, a complete neurologic assessment or stool guaiac testing may yield information about secondary causes for syncope.

An ECG should be obtained for patients with syncope to assess for signs of ischemia or dysrhythmia. Suggestive ECG findings include prolonged QT interval, which may indicate a propensity for torsades des pointes, or PR interval shortening with a delta wave diagnostic for Wolf-ParkinsonWhite  syndrome.  Prolonged  cardiac  monitoring  may  show  a  transient recurrent  dysrhythmia.  Laboratory  testing  should  be  selective  based  on history  and  physical  examination.  An  abnormal  hemoglobin  level  in  a patient with symptoms suggestive of anemia may explain orthostatic syncope  and  direct  further  workup.  Women  of  childbearing  age  warrant  a pregnancy test. Although not recommended routinely, serum electrolytes may be helpful in limited cases. If a patient is asymptomatic or does not have trauma, neuroimaging is not typically indicated in the routine workup of syncope.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

By definition, syncope results in spontaneous recovery of consciousness. Therefore, the main goal of ED care is to identify those patients at risk for further medical problems.

Acute  heart  failure  covers  a  wide  spectrum  of  illness,  with  symptoms ranging  from  a  gradual  increase  in  leg  swelling,  shortness  of  breath,  or decreased exercise tolerance to the abrupt onset of pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. While the term congestive heart failure was historically used to describe volume overload, current terminology describes patients as having acute heart failure when they present with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure or when new-onset heart failure is diagnosed. Heart failure  has  a  poor  prognosis  with  an  approximately  50%  mortality  rate within 5 years of initial diagnosis. The most common precipitating factors of acute heart failure are atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction or ischemia,  discontinuation  of  medications  (diuretics),  increased  sodium load, drugs that impair myocardial function, and physical overexertion.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

No single historical or physical finding is sensitive and specific enough to accurately diagnose acute heart failure in all patients. On physical examination, patients with acute heart failure may present with dyspnea, frothy pink sputum, or respiratory distress. Patients are frequently tachycardic and hypertensive,  and  a  third  heart  sound  (S3)  may  be  identified  on  auscultation. Abdominojugular reflux and jugular venous distension may also be seen.

Acute heart failure can be further classified as follows:

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Commonly, patients with acute heart failure present with dyspnea and the differential diagnosis may include other conditions such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia,  pneumothorax,  pleural  effusion,  pulmonary  embolus,  and

149

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

acute coronary syndrome. There is no single diagnostic test for heart failure; it is a clinical diagnosis based on the history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. The most useful historical parameter is a history of acute heart  failure.  The  symptom  with  the  highest  sensitivity  for  diagnosis  is dyspnea on exertion (84%) and the most specific symptoms are paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and edema (77% to 84%).

Chest radiographs showing pulmonary venous congestion, cardiomegaly,  and  interstitial  edema  are  the  most  specific  for  a  diagnosis  of  acute heart failure, although up to 20% of patients may have an initially negative CXR. ECG is not useful for diagnosis, although it may reveal an underlying cause  or  precipitant.  BNP  (B-type  natriuretic  peptide/ N -terminal  B-type natriuretic  peptide)  testing  is  useful  to  supplement  provider  assessment when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Bedside cardiac ultrasound may be useful to determine other causes for acute dyspnea, such as cardiac tamponade, and  may  also  be  useful  to  determine  left  ventricle  function  and  volume status or identify signs of pulmonary congestion. These ancillary tests combined  with  an  appropriate  history  and  physical  can  help  determine  the likelihood of acute heart failure.

# Valvular Emergencies

Boyd Burns

Many patients  with  chronic  cardiac  valve  abnormalities  who  present  for emergency care have previously established disease. Acute valvular dysfunction can present with significant symptoms, and emergency physicians must be alert to the presenting signs and symptoms to identify the undiagnosed patient. With bedside echocardiography becoming more commonly available, the initial diagnosis of valvular disease may become more common in the ED.

# ■ THE NEWLY DISCOVERED MURMUR

When an emergency provider identifies a new murmur on exam, the first step in the ED is to determine the potential clinical significance of this finding. Benign murmurs are not likely to cause symptoms and may be found incidentally. These are typically soft systolic ejection murmurs and occur after S 1 and end before S 2 and are not associated with specific symptoms. In contrast, a new diastolic murmur or a new systolic murmur with symptoms  at  rest  warrants  emergent  echocardiographic  imaging  and  further evaluation.  In  addition,  risks  for  possible  infections  such  as  endocarditis should be considered in patients with a newly discovered murmur and the presence of fever (Fig. 23-1).

# ■ MITRAL STENOSIS

# Clinical Features

Mitral stenosis prevents normal diastolic filling of the left ventricle, and dyspnea  with  exertion  is  the  most  common  presenting  symptom.  In  the past, hemoptysis was the second most common presenting symptom, but this is less common now that patients are typically diagnosed and treated earlier  in  the  disease  course.  As  the  obstructive  process  progresses,  left atrial  pressures  rise  and  lead  to  left  atrial  enlargement  and  symptoms  of heart failure. Systemic emboli may develop, especially when accompanied by atrial fibrillation, and can result in myocardial, kidney, central nervous system, or peripheral infarction. Most patients with mitral stenosis eventually  develop  atrial  fibrillation  due  to  progressive  dilatation  of  the  atria. The  classic  murmur  of  mitral  stenosis  and  associated  signs  are  listed  in Table 23-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

In the presence of mitral stenosis, the electrocardiogram (ECG) may demonstrate notched or diphasic P waves and right axis deviation. On the chest radiograph, straightening of the left heart border is a typical early radiographic finding suggestive of left atrial enlargement. Later in the illness, findings of pulmonary congestion develop, such as redistribution of flow to the upper lung fields, Kerley B lines, and an increase in vascular markings.

CHAPTER 23: Valvular Emergencies

The diagnosis of mitral stenosis is confirmed with echocardiography. The urgency for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate referral depends on the severity  of  symptoms  and  initial  management  will  typically  focus  on symptom control.

# ■ MITRAL REGURGITATION

# Clinical Features

Acute mitral regurgitation secondary to rupture of the chordae tendineae or papillary  muscles  (or  rarely  due  to  blunt  thoracic  trauma)  presents  with dyspnea, tachycardia, and pulmonary edema as the acute valvular dysfunction allows retrograde flow of blood to occur from the left ventricle to the left  atrium.  These  patients  may  quickly  develop  cardiogenic  shock  or cardiac arrest. Intermittent mitral regurgitation usually presents with acute episodes  of  respiratory  distress  due  to  pulmonary  edema  and  may  be asymptomatic  between  attacks.  In  contrast,  chronic  mitral  regurgitation may be tolerated by patients for many years without specific treatment. In these cases, the first symptom is usually dyspnea with exertion that is sometimes precipitated by new-onset atrial fibrillation. If patients are not appropriately  anticoagulated,  systemic  emboli  may  occur  in  up  to  20%  of patients and may initially be asymptomatic. The classic murmur and signs of mitral regurgitation are listed in Table 23-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Consider mitral regurgitation in a patient without significant cardiomegaly who presents with new onset and marked pulmonary edema. In an acute valvular rupture, the ECG may show evidence of acute inferior wall infarction  or  ischemia.  On  chest  radiography,  acute  mitral  regurgitation  from papillary muscle rupture may result in a minimally enlarged left atrium and pulmonary edema. In chronic disease, the ECG may demonstrate findings of left atrial and left ventricular hypertrophy associated with corresponding enlargement visible on chest radiography.

Echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis, and bedside testing may be needed in an acutely ill patient. While transthoracic echocardiography can help to make the diagnosis, this technique may underestimate lesion severity.  Therefore,  transesophageal  echo  should  be  used  for  definitive diagnostic purposes when a patient is stable and able to have this testing completed.

# ■ MITRAL VALVE pROLApSE

# Clinical Features

Most patients with mitral valve prolapse are asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, patients may report atypical chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, and dyspnea. The abnormal heart sounds are listed in Table 23-1. In patients with  mitral  valve  prolapse  who  do  not  have  mitral  regurgitation  at  rest, exercise can provoke mitral regurgitation in about one-third of patients and is associated with a higher risk for morbid events.

# Diagnosis and Differential

This diagnosis is unlikely to be made in the ED as the ECG and chest x-ray are usually normal. Echocardiography is recommended nonemergently to confirm the clinical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and to identify any associated  mitral  regurgitation.  Echocardiography  or  consultation  with  a cardiologist can be performed on an outpatient basis and specific ED treatment for this conditionis rarely required.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ AORTIC STENOSIS

# Clinical Features

Aortic stenosis presents an obstruction to left ventricular outflow. In the United Sates, the most common cause in adults is degenerative calcification associated  with  increasing  age,  hypertension,  smoking,  elevated  cholesterol, and diabetes. The classic triad of symptoms is dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope. Dyspnea is usually the first symptom to appear, followed by paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope on exertion, angina, and myocardial infarction. The classic murmur and associated signs of aortic stenosis are listed in Table 23-1. Blood pressure is typically normal or low, with a narrow pulse pressure.

Brachioradial delay is often present in aortic stenosis. To evaluate for this finding, the examiner palpates simultaneously the right brachial artery

--- Page 176 ---

156 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

and the right radial artery of the patient, and any palpable delay is considered  abnormal.  Because  patients  with  aortic  stenosis  are  very  preload dependent, the presence of atrial fibrillation may have significant consequences, as the absence of effective atrial  contraction  leads  to  a  drop  in cardiac output. This can lead to hypotension, especially when patients are treated with nitroglycerin for chest pain or dyspnea.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Electrocardiogram  and  chest  radiographic  findings  lack  sensitivity  and specificity for aortic stenosis. The ECG often demonstrates criteria for LVH and may have a left or right bundle branch block in up to 10% of patients. The chest radiograph is normal early, but eventually LVH and findings of congestive  heart  failure  will  develop  if  the  patient  does  not  have  valve replacement.  Transthoracic  echocardiography  can  confirm  the  suspected diagnosis of aortic stenosis and determine disease severity.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ AORTIC REGURGITATION

# Clinical Features

Aortic regurgitation occurs when valve leaflets do not fully close and result in  retrograde  flow  of  blood  from  the  aorta  into  the  left  ventricle  during diastole. In acute disease, dyspnea from pulmonary edema is the most common presenting symptom. Patients may also complain of fever and chills when  endocarditis  is  the  underlying  cause.  Dissection  of  the  ascending aorta  that  impacts  the  function  of  the  aortic  valve  typically  produces  a 'tearing' chest pain that may radiate between the shoulder blades. The classic murmur and signs of aortic regurgitation are listed in Table 23-1. Tachycardia develops in an attempt to maintain cardiac output in the setting of acute aortic regurgitation, although this may be inadequate and cardiogenic shock or arrest may occur.

Chronic aortic regurgitation typically presents with gradually worsening fatigue or dyspnea with exertion. Signs include a wide pulse pressure with a prominent ventricular impulse, and may be associated with head bobbing. A 'water hammer pulse' characterized by a quick rise in peripheral pulse upstroke followed by a rapid collapse may also be present. Other classic findings may include an accentuated precordial apical thrust, pulsus bisferiens, a 'to-and-fro' femoral murmur (Duroziez sign), and capillary pulsations visible at the proximal nailbed while pressure is applied at the tip (Quincke sign).

CHAPTER 23: Valvular Emergencies

157

# Diagnosis and Differential

In  patients  with  acute  aortic  regurgitation,  the  chest  radiograph  demonstrates acute pulmonary edema with less cardiac enlargement than may be expected. When an aortic dissection is the underlying cause, a chest x-ray may demonstrate a widened mediastinum and prompt ordering of a CT of the chest with IV contrast. ECG changes that may be seen with aortic dissection include ischemia or findings of acute inferior myocardial infarction suggesting right coronary artery involvement.

In  chronic  aortic  regurgitation,  the  ECG  demonstrates  LVH,  and  the chest radiograph may demonstrate LVH, aortic dilation, and/or evidence of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography is used to confirm the diagnosis and severity of valvular regurgitation. Bedside transthoracic echocardiography can be undertaken to further evaluate an unstable patient who may need emergency surgery.  Otherwise,  transesophageal  echocardiography  is  recommended when aortic dissection is suspected to more completely evaluate the aorta and valvular function.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ RIGHT-SIDED VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

Pathologic  tricuspid  regurgitation  is  typically  due  to  elevated  right  heart pressures  or  volume  overload,  which  can  be  seen  in  conditions  such  as pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease, pulmonary embolism, and/ or atrial septal defects. Acute tricuspid disease is most often found in the setting  of  acute  endocarditis  from  organisms  such  as Staphylococcus aureus , which can lead to rapid valve destruction.

The pulmonic valve is least affected by acquired disease and most disease present here is congenital. Pulmonary hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and carcinoid syndrome can all cause some degree of pulmonic valve disease.

# Clinical Features

Clinically significant right-sided valvular disease leads to right heart failure symptoms  such  as  jugular  venous  distension,  peripheral  edema,  hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites. Dyspnea with exertion is often the first

--- Page 178 ---

158 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

symptom in patients with right-sided valvular disease associated with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonic stenosis often presents with dyspnea with exertion,  syncope,  chest  pain,  and  findings  consistent  with  right  heart failure.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis of right-sided valvular disease, and the transesophageal approach is more sensitive than transthoracic.  Chest  x-ray  and  ECG  lack  sensitivity  and  specificity,  although chest radiography may demonstrate evidence of right atrial enlargement or right ventricular hypertrophy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ pROSTHETIC VALVE DISEASE

Prosthetic valves are divided into two major groups: mechanical and bioprosthetic. Mechanical valves are more durable but require lifelong anticoagulation secondary to the thrombotic risk. Bioprosthetic valves, whether from bovine, porcine, or human sources, are less thrombogenic but more likely to fail and require repeat surgical repair.

Systemic thromboembolism is a common complication of mechanical heart valves, and therefore lifelong anticoagulation is recommended. Anticoagulation decreases the thrombotic risk from 8% to 1-2% per year. The risk for embolic complications is highest during the first three postoperative months, and prosthetic mitral valves are more likely than prosthetic aortic valves to produce emboli.

Malfunction  of  prosthetic  valves  can  occur  in  many  ways  including thrombosis, dehiscence of sutures, gradual degeneration, or sudden fracture.  Symptom  progression  is  typically  gradual  except  in  acute  failure, which can present with an acute onset of respiratory distress, pulmonary edema,  and  cardiogenic  shock.  Infectious  complications  of  endocarditis carry a high mortality rate and occur in 6% of patients within 5 years of surgery.

# Clinical Features

The replacement of a diseased or damaged valve relieves the obstruction or regurgitation that had developed, but any cardiac remodeling that occurred over time due to the abnormal valve will remain and can lead to chronic symptoms. Many patients will have continued dyspnea or other symptoms of heart failure because of the long-standing volume or pressure overload. These patients are also likely to have comorbid conditions such as coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension or atrial fibrillation.

--- Page 179 ---

CHAPTER 23: Valvular Emergencies

159

Thromboembolism from a prosthetic valve source may cause transient neurologic symptoms, ischemic stroke, or ischemic episodes in an affected extremity  or  organ. Although  anticoagulation  can  minimize  the  risks  of thromboembolism, this is associated with its own potential complications from increased bleeding risks such as hemorrhagic stroke.

Acute failure of a prosthetic valve presents with acute respiratory distress,  pulmonary  edema,  and  cardiogenic  shock  and  can  be  caused  by mechanical valve failure, tearing of a bioprothesis, or presence of a large obstructive clot preventing proper closure of the valve. An acute valve failure often results in sudden death before emergent corrective surgery can be performed. A paravalvular leak may present with new congestive failure symptoms with severity based on the degree of the leak.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Patients with prosthetic valves who present with new or increasing dyspnea on exertion, congestive heart failure, or chest pain are at risk for valvular malfunction. Patients with new neurologic symptoms may have thromboembolic disease or hemorrhagic stroke from excessive anticoagulation. The presence  of  a  persistent  fever  or  fever  without  a  source  should  prompt concern for endocarditis, as patients with prosthetic valves are at increased risk for this infection.

# The Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis, and Pericardial Disease

# Lorraine Thibodeau

Cardiomyopathies are the third most prevalent form of heart disease in the United States. Cardiomyopathies alter cardiac structure, myocardial func­ tion,  and/or  electrical  conduction.  Primary  cardiomyopathies  principally affect the myocardium and secondary cardiomyopathies are associated with other specific systemic disorders. Cardiomyopathies can be further catego­ rized by systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction.

# ■ PRIMARY CARDIOMYOPATHIES WITH SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION

# Dilated Cardiomyopathy

Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy over­ all and is usually idiopathic, but may be familial or associated with specific associated causes. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of dilated cardio­ myopathy that affects pregnant women from 20 weeks gestation into the postpartum period. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by systolic and diastolic dysfunction and is the primary indication for cardiac transplant in the United States.

# Clinical Features

Most patients with dilated cardiomyopathy present with signs and symp­ toms  of  acute  heart  failure  from  systolic  pump  dysfunction.  Symptoms include  dyspnea  on  exertion,  orthopnea,  and  paroxysmal  nocturnal  dys­ pnea. Physical findings include rales, dependent edema, an enlarged liver, and a holosystolic murmur. Patients may also present with chest pain which may be a function of limited coronary vascular reserve.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Typical  chest  radiograph  and  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  findings  can  be helpful, but the definitive diagnosis is typically made by echocardiogram. Chest radiographs usually show an enlarged cardiac silhouette, biventri­ cular  enlargement,  and  pulmonary  vascular  congestion.  The  ECG  often shows left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, Q or QS waves, and poor R wave progression across the precordium. The diagnostic echo­ cardiogram shows a decreased ejection fraction, ventricular enlargement, and  increased  systolic  and  diastolic  volumes.  The  differential  diagnosis includes acute myocardial infarction, restrictive pericarditis, acute valvu­ lar disruption, sepsis, or any other condition that results in a low cardiac output state.

160

--- Page 181 ---

CHAPTER 24: The Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis, and Pericardial Disease 161

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Patients  with  symptomatic  or  newly  diagnosed  dilated  cardiomyopathy typically  require  admission  to  a  monitored  bed  or  intensive  care  unit depending on severity of presentation. Patients with known dilated cardio­ myopathy benefit from identification of an underlying cause for an exacer­ bation, including myocardial ischemia, anemia, infection, new­onset atrial fibrillation,  bradydysrhythmia,  valvular  insufficiency,  renal  dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, or thyroid dysfunction.

# Myocarditis

Myocarditis is a common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium and may be the result of a systemic disorder or an infectious agent including viral or bacterial etiologies. Peri­ carditis frequently accompanies myocarditis.

# Clinical Features

Systemic  signs  and  symptoms  of  myocarditis  are  nonspecific  and  can include myalgias, headache, rigors, and fever and tachycardia. Chest pain with a coexisting pericarditis is frequently present and may be accompanied by a pericardial friction rub. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of progressive heart failure with dyspnea on exertion, pulmonary rales, pedal edema, and/or cardiogenic shock.

# Diagnosis and Differential

ECG may be normal or may demonstrate nonspecific changes such as atrioventricular block, prolonged QRS duration, or ST­segment elevation and PR depression if there is accompanying pericarditis. Chest radiogra­ phy is typically normal, but may demonstrate pulmonary congestion if symptoms  are  severe.  Cardiac  enzymes  may  be  elevated.  Differential diagnosis includes cardiac ischemia or infarction, valvular disease, and sepsis.

162 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Left Ventricular Assist Devices

In patients with severe cardiomyopathy, LVADs may be used to augment left  ventricular  output.  These  devices  consist  of  an  implanted  pump  that transfers blood from the apex of the left ventricle to the proximal aorta. The pump  receives  its  power  from  an  external  source  (a  battery  or  bedside power unit outside of the body) that is connected to a controller outside of the body. The controller drives the pump via a drive line that connects the pump to the outside battery and controller through a small abdominal wall incision.

Patients and their families usually have extensive training on the devices and should be involved in the evaluation of the LVAD patient. In addition, most patients will carry a card with their LV AD coordinator's contact infor­ mation in the bag with their spare battery and controller. It is imperative to contact  these  coordinators  as  soon  as  possible  to  discuss  diagnostic  and management options.

# Clinical Features

Most  LVADs  now  employ  pumps  that  create  continuous  blood  flow  to maintain a normal mean arterial pressure. However, because flow is con­ tinuous, many LVAD patients may not have a normal palpable pulse. Blood pressure readings can be obtained via Doppler or mechanical cuff. Auscul­ tation reveals heart sounds associated with a whirr from the LVAD pump. The ECG should have discernible QRS complexes. The chest radiograph should show the LVAD components in place.

163

# ■ CARDIOMYOPATHIES WITH DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION

# Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  is  characterized  by  asymmetric  left  ven­ tricular and/or right ventricular hypertrophy primarily involving the intra­ ventricular septum. The result is decreased compliance of the left ventricle leading to impaired diastolic relaxation and diastolic filling. Cardiac out­ put  and  ejection  fraction  are  usually  normal.  This  condition  is  often hereditary.

# Clinical Features

The type and severity of symptoms depend on age and tend to be more severe  as  patients  get  older.  Dyspnea  on  exertion  is  the  most  common symptom, followed by chest pain, palpitations, and syncope. Patients may be aware of forceful ventricular contractions as well. Physical exam usually reveals a fourth heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the lower left sternal boarder or apex that does not typically radiate to the neck. The examiner may enhance this murmur by having the patient Val­ salva or stand, and a decrease in the murmur may be heard with maneuvers that increase LV filling such as squatting and passive leg elevation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The ECG in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is nonspecific, but often demon­ strates  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  and  left  atrial  enlargement.  Deep  S waves may be seen with large septal Q waves ( > 0.3 mV) and upright T waves.  In  contrast,  inverted  T  waves  can  suggest  ischemia.  Chest  radio­ graph is usually normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic study of choice and will demonstrate disproportionate septal hypertrophy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment  is  primarily  supportive.  Patients  with  suspected  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be referred for echocardiographic evaluation.

--- Page 184 ---

164 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

# Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

This type of cardiomyopathy is relatively uncommon and can be idiopathic or caused by a number of different etiologies such as sarcoidosis, sclero­ derma,  and  amyloidosis.  In  this  disorder,  ventricular  filling  is  restricted leading to normal or diminished diastolic volume while systolic function is usually normal.

# Clinical Features

The predominant symptoms are dyspnea, orthopnea, and pedal edema that occur without associated cardiomegaly or systolic dysfunction. Chest pain is  uncommon. Physical examination is consistent with the degree of dis­ ease, and may show a third or fourth heart sound, cardiac gallop, pulmonary rales,  jugular  venous  distension,  inspiratory  jugular  venous  distention (Kussmaul's sign), hepatomegaly, pedal edema, or ascites.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The ECG is usually nonspecific, but may show conduction disturbances or low voltage in the setting of sarcoidosis or amyloidosis. The chest radio­ graph  may  show  signs  of  acute  heart  failure  without  cardiomegaly.  The differential  diagnosis  includes  constrictive  pericarditis  and  diastolic  left ventricular  dysfunction.  Differentiating  between  restrictive  cardiomyopa­ thy and constrictive pericarditis is important as constrictive pericarditis can be treated surgically.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Acute Pericarditis

Pericarditis involves inflammation of the layers covering the heart and may be idiopathic or due to infections such as a virus, bacteria, or fungus. Other etiologies include malignancy, drugs, radiation, connective tissue disease, uremia, myxedema, or postmyocardial infarction (Dressler's syndrome).

# Clinical Features

The most common symptom of pericarditis is sharp or stabbing precordial or retrosternal chest pain that may radiate to the back, neck, shoulder, or arm. The classic description is pain that is made worse by lying supine, and lessened by sitting up and leaning slightly forward. Movement, swallowing, or inspiration may also aggravate the pain. Radiation to the left trapezial ridge is distinctive. Associated symptoms include recent or current infec­ tion,  low­grade  intermittent  fever,  dyspnea,  and  dysphagia.  The  physical exam is usually normal, but an intermittent friction rub heard best at the lower left sternal border or apex may be present.

--- Page 185 ---

CHAPTER 24: The Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis, and Pericardial Disease 165

# Diagnosis and Differential

ECG changes of acute pericarditis and its convalescence have been divided into four stages. Stage 1 demonstrates diffuse ST­segment elevation, espe­ cially in leads I, V5, and V6, with PR­segment depression in leads II, aVF, and V4­6. As the disease begins to resolve (stage 2), the ST segments nor­ malize  and  T­wave  amplitudes  decrease.  In  stage  3,  T­wave  inversion appears in leads previously showing ST elevations. Finally, stage 4 shows resolution of repolarization abnormalities and a return to a normal ECG.

When sequential ECGs are not available, it can be difficult to distin­ guish  pericarditis  from  a  normal  variant  with  'early  repolarization.'  In these  cases,  the  finding  of  a  ST­segment/T­wave  amplitude  ratio  greater than 0.25 in leads I, V5, or V6 is suggestive of acute pericarditis.

Chest x­ray is usually normal but may show an enlarged cardiac silhou­ ette if a large pericardial effusion is present. Echocardiography can be used to  assess  for  the  presence  of  an  associated  pericardial  effusion.  Routine laboratory  testing  may  reveal  additional  abnormalities  including  an  ele­ vated creatine kinase or troponin in the setting of associated myocarditis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Nontraumatic Cardiac Tamponade

When fluid accumulates in the pericardial space and eventually exceeds the filling pressure of the right ventricle, cardiac tamponade occurs resulting in restricted filling and decreased cardiac output. Potential etiologies include uremia,  malignant  effusion,  hemorrhage  associated  with  anticoagulation, bacterial or tubercular infection, chronic pericarditis, lupus, radiation, myx­ edema, or idiopathic.

# Clinical Features

Patients with cardiac tamponade may present with mild to severe shock, and the most common chief complaint is dyspnea. Physical findings can include tachycardia, low systolic blood pressure, and a narrow pulse pres­ sure. Pulsus paradoxus (a drop in systolic pressure greater than 10 mm Hg during normal inspiration), neck vein distention, distant heart sounds, and right  upper  quadrant  pain  (due  to  hepatic  congestion)  may  be  present. Pulmonary rales are usually absent.

# Diagnosis and Differential

ECG may demonstrate  low­voltage  QRS  complexes  and  ST  elevations with  PR  depression  as  in  pericarditis.  Electrical  alternans  (beat­to­beat

--- Page 186 ---

166 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

variability in the amplitude of the P and R waves unrelated to inspiratory cycle) is a classic but uncommon finding. Chest radiograph may or may not show an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Bedside ultrasound or echocar­ diogram is the diagnostic test of choice and demonstrates a large pericar­ dial effusion with right atrium or ventricle diastolic collapse.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Cardiac tamponade is a rare and challenging diagnosis and when unrecog­ nized can lead to hypotension and cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA).

# Constrictive Pericarditis

Pericardial injury and inflammation can lead to abnormal diastolic filling of the cardiac chambers, which may lead to constrictive pericarditis. Poten­ tial  causes include fungal or tuberculous pericarditis, uremic pericarditis, postcardiac trauma, and postsurgical changes after pericardiotomy.

# Clinical Features

Typical presentations involve the gradual development of symptoms similar to heart failure and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Common signs and symp­ toms include exertional dyspnea, pedal edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites. Kussmaul's  sign  (inspiratory  neck  vein  distention)  is  frequently  seen  in patients with constrictive pericarditis.

ECG findings are nonspecific, but may include low­voltage QRS com­ plexes and inverted T waves. Chest radiography may demonstrate normal or slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Two­dimensional echocardiography is typically not useful, while CT scan, MRI, or Doppler echocardiography can be helpful for making this diagnosis.

# Venous Thromboembolism

Christopher Kabrhel

Venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  includes  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT occurs when blood coagulates inside a deep vein such as those in the leg, arm, or pelvis. Most PEs occur when a  portion  of  a  venous  clot  breaks  off,  travels  through  the  venous  system through the right side of the heart, and subsequently enters a pulmonary artery. The clinical presentation of VTE is highly variable, thus clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis. Mortality from VTE is variable, with case fatality rates ranging from 1% to 45%, depending on the clinical presentation and comorbid conditions.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

There  are  numerous  factors  that  affect  the  risk  of VTE  and  the  clinical presentation. Factors that increase the risk of VTE include advanced age, obesity, pregnancy, prior VTE, malignancy, inherited thrombophilia, recent surgery or major trauma, immobility, an indwelling central venous catheter, smoking,  long-distance  travel,  congestive  heart  failure,  stroke,  estrogen use, and inflammatory conditions.

# Deep Vein Thrombosis

Patients with lower extremity DVT often present with calf or leg pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, and warmth. Patients with upper extremity DVT, which often occurs in the setting of an indwelling catheter, present with similar symptoms in an upper extremity. This classic constellation of findings is present in fewer than 50% of DVT patients, and while a 2-cm difference in lower leg circumference is predictive, pain in the calf with forced dorsiflexion of the foot (Homans' sign) is neither sensitive nor specific for DVT.

Uncommon but severe presentations of DVT include phlegmasia cerulea dolens and phlegmasia alba dolens . Phlegmasia cerulea dolens presents as an extremely swollen and cyanotic limb due to a high-grade obstruction that elevates compartment pressures and can compromise limb perfusion. Phlegmasia alba dolens has  a  similar  pathophysiology  but  presents  as  a pale limb secondary to arterial spasm.

# Pulmonary Embolism

The  clinical  presentation  of  PE  is  highly  variable,  ranging  from  sudden death to incidental diagnosis in patients who are completely asymptomatic. Consider the possibility of PE in a patient who experiences acute dyspnea, pleuritic  chest  pain,  unexplained  tachycardia,  hypoxemia,  syncope,  or shock-especially in the absence of physical examination or radiographic findings for alternative diagnoses. The most common symptoms of an acute PE are dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Syncope occurs in 3% to 4% of patients with PE, which can be accompanied by convulsions or seizures. Physical findings that may accompany a PE include hypoxemia, tachypnea,

167

--- Page 188 ---

168

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

tachycardia, hemoptysis, diaphoresis, and low-grade fever. Clinical signs of DVT occur in about 50% of patients with PE. Massive PE can cause hypotension, severe hypoxemia, or cardiopulmonary arrest. However, the clinical presentation of VTE can be insidious and there may be poor correlation between the size of a PE and the severity of symptoms.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The extremity pain and swelling associated with DVT are similar to other diagnoses such as cellulitis, congestive heart failure, musculoskeletal injuries,  and venous stasis without thrombosis. The differential diagnosis for patients with symptoms concerning for PE may include many other pulmonary disorders, such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Cardiac disorders with  symptoms similar  to  PE  can  include  angina,  myocardial  infarction, congestive heart failure, pericarditis, and tachydysrhythmia. Muscle strain and costochondritis can mimic the pleuritic chest pain of PE. The presence of hypoxemia or dyspnea with clear lungs on physical exam and negative radiographic imaging prompt consideration for PE as a possible diagnosis.

# Pretest Probability Assessment

Estimating the pretest probability for VTE is the first step for selecting a diagnostic pathway. Aggressive diagnostic testing can cause harm disproportionate to benefit, and therefore specific testing for PE is typically recommended for patients whose probability of disease is higher than 2.5%. Below this threshold, diagnostic testing is more likely to harm than help an individual patient. When a clinician's clinical gestalt after history and physical examination is that an individual patient is low risk for PE, the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) rule can help to identify patients for whom specific diagnostic testing is not recommended (Table 25-1).

For patients that may need additional diagnostic testing, there are several clinical scoring systems that can be used to calculate a patient's pretest probability of VTE. The most robust systems are the Wells' Scores for PE and DVT (Tables 25-2 and 25-3).

# Diagnostic Testing

For patients who need additional testing and have low or intermediate pretest probability, serum d-dimer testing is the recommended initial test. The diagnostic sensitivity of automated quantitative d-dimer assays ranges from 94% to 98% and the specificity from 50% to 60% for PE and DVT. The d-dimer has  a  half-life  of  approximately  8  hours  and  can  be  elevated  for  at  least 3  days  after  symptomatic  VTE.  Advanced  age,  pregnancy,  active  malignancy,  recent  surgery,  liver  disease,  rheumatologic  disease,  infection, trauma, and sickle cell disease can all elevate d-dimer levels in the absence of VTE. d-dimer cutoffs for use in screening for VTE can be adjusted for age to maintain adequate exclusionary ability.

is age × 10 ng/mL to determine the upper limit of normal. For patients with high pretest probability of VTE, those with a positive d-dimer, or those in whom d-dimer testing is very likely to be positive, imaging is indicated.

Figure  25-1  illustrates  a  recommended  diagnostic  pathway  for  suspected DVT. Patients with a low pretest probability of DVT can be adequately evaluated with a serum d-dimer. Patients with a moderate or high pretest probability for DVT or those who have a positive d-dimer should undergo venous ultrasound (US). Venous US is nonionizing and has high sensitivity (90% to 95%) and specificity (95%) for lower extremity DVT. Sensitivity of venous US is lower for pelvic and isolated calf DVT and in obese patients. To rule out DVT in patients with high clinical probability, some diagnostic algorithms recommend both a negative initial ultrasound and  a  concurrent  negative  d-dimer  or  a  follow-up  ultrasound  performed 1 week after the initial negative testing.

Figure  25-2  shows  one  recommended  diagnostic  algorithm  for  PE, though  no  singular  diagnostic  test  or  approach  perfectly  diagnoses  or excludes PE. For patients who need radiographic imaging to evaluate for PE, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography of the chest is the test  of  choice  (see  Fig.  25-3)  where  a  blood  clot  appears  as  a  filling defect  in  a  contrast-enhanced  pulmonary  artery.  The  sensitivity  of  a technically  adequate  CT  for  PE  is  about  90%,  and  specificity  is  95%. Unfortunately, about 10% of scans are technically inadequate and should be interpreted with this limitation in mind. The negative likelihood ratio of a CT scan is 0.12, which is similar to that of a negative d-dimer. Therefore,

--- Page 191 ---

CHAPTER 25: Venous Thromboembolism

171

as with d-dimer testing, CT scan results should be interpreted in the appropriate context of pretest probability. Compared to other imaging modalities, CT  scanning  has  the  advantage  of  demonstrating  important  alternative diagnoses in 18% to 22% of patients.

Ventilation-perfusion ( V ˙ / Q ˙ ) scanning is another testing option to assess for possible PE. This is performed by comparing emission of radioisotope that has been injected into the pulmonary arteries to emission of radioisotope

172

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

that has been inhaled into the alveoli. A V ˙ / Q ˙ scan that demonstrates homogeneous scintillation throughout the lung in the perfusion portion rules out PE with 100% sensitivity. A V ˙ / Q ˙ scan with two or more unmatched filling defects indicates 80% probability of PE. However, only about one-third of V ˙ / Q ˙ scans demonstrate findings sufficient to diagnose or rule out PE with certainty.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The treatment of VTE consists of initial stabilization, anticoagulation, and thrombolytic or surgical therapy in severe cases. All patients suspected of having  PE  should  have  their  cardiac  rhythm,  blood  pressure,  and  pulse oxygenation measured.

Fibrinolysis may also benefit patients with submassive PE that  is  associated  with  right  heart  strain  on  echocardiogram,  elevated troponin or B-type natriuetric peptide, or severe hypoxemia and respiratory distress. In these patients fibrinolysis is associated with improved survival  and  quality  of  life,  but  with  an  increased  risk  of  bleedingespecially among patients > 65 years old. Alteplase (tPA)  is  the  only fibrinolytic available in the United States that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of PE and is administered as 100 mg infused over 2 hours.

176 SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

# ■ CLINICaL FeatUreS

Patients presenting with elevated blood pressure and accompanying acute symptoms  often  provide  a  history  of  hypertension.  Many  patients  have coexisting  medical  conditions  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  renal  dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or renal artery stenosis. Secondary precipitants  of  acute  hypertension  may  include  pregnancy,  sympathomimetic  toxicity,  adverse  drug  reactions,  drug-drug  interactions,  or  withdrawal from medications or recreational substances.

When a significantly  elevated  blood  pressure  is  present,  consider  the possibility of hypertensive emergency in patients with any of the following signs and symptoms of target organ involvement:

Consider preeclampsia in pregnant or recently postpartum patients with hypertension, hyperreflexia, and peripheral edema. Consider coarctation or aortic  dissection  in  patients  with  hypertension,  asymmetric  peripheral pulses, and unequal blood pressures.

# ■ DIaGNOSIS aND DIFFereNtIaL

The primary goal of diagnostic testing is to reveal evidence of target organ injury  when  such  injury  is  not  otherwise  clinically  obvious.  Urinalysis, pregnancy testing, and electrocardiograms are commonly ordered. When indicated  in  specific  cases,  additional  testing  such  as  metabolic  profiles, toxicology screens, and radiographic imaging may provide additional supporting data. See Table 26-2.

Hematuria, proteinuria, and red cell casts on urinalysis, coupled with serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium elevations, suggest renal  injury.  Electrocardiographic  abnormalities  may  reflect  cardiac  or renal  dysfunction  with  findings  such  as  tachycardia,  altered  QRS  waveforms, and ST segment or T-wave changes. Chest radiographs may reveal findings of acute pulmonary edema or mediastinal widening suggestive of acute aortic dissection. Computed tomography or ultrasound may be necessary to confirm clinical suspicions when plain radiographs are nondiagnostic.  Computed  tomography  of  the  head  may  reveal  ischemic  changes, edema, or hemorrhage.

Hypertensive  emergencies  in  children,  as  for  adults,  refer  to  profoundly elevated  blood  pressures  associated  with  target  organ  damage.  Neonates often present with nonspecific signs such as apnea, cyanosis, or poor feeding. Older children may present with symptoms and physical examination findings  more  typical  of  adults  such  as  throbbing  frontal  headaches  or blurred vision.

Renovascular lesions and pheochromocytoma are the most commonly identified etiologies for pediatric hypertensive emergencies. The decision to treat a hypertensive emergency in a child is based on the blood pressure and associated symptoms indicating target organ damage. Consider urgent treatment if the hypertensive blood pressure exceeds prior measurements by 30%, or if diastolic or systolic blood pressures exceed the 90th to 95th percentiles on a standardized table of blood pressure by age. The primary

--- Page 200 ---

180

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

therapeutic goal for blood pressure control in an acutely symptomatic child with a hypertensive emergency is to lower the mean arterial pressure by 25% within 1 hour. Preferred medications include labetalol 0.2 to 1 mg/kg IV to a maximum of 40 mg per dose or a continuous infusion of 0.25 to 3 mg/kg/h or nicardipine 0.5 to 3 µg/kg/min IV.

The second-line agents include hydralazine 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg IV to a maximum of 20 mg per dose, esmolol 100 to 500 µg/kg followed by an infusion of 50 to 150 µg/kg/min, or clevidipine 0.5  to  3.5  µg/kg/min IV . Refractory cases may be treated with nitroprusside 0.5 to 10 µg/kg/min IV. Phentolamine 0.1 mg/kg IV to a maximum of 5 mg is the drug of choice for significantly elevated blood pressure in the setting of a pheochromocytoma, while awaiting definitive surgical treatment.

# ■ pULMONarY hYperteNSION

Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by an elevated pressure within the pulmonary vascular system compromising right ventricular function. Pulmonary  hypertension  is  defined  as  a  mean  pulmonary  artery  pressure exceeding 25 mm Hg at rest or 30 mm Hg with exertion. Pulmonary hypertension can manifest with isolated pulmonary arterial pressure elevations or combined  pulmonary  arterial  and  venous  pressure  elevations.  Definitive diagnosis requires right heart catheterization.

The  most  common  symptom  of  pulmonary  hypertension  is  dyspnea, either at rest or with exertion. Other symptoms include fatigue, syncope or near-syncope, and chest pain. Typically, this disorder will be seen in association with other cardiovascular or pulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  left  ventricular  dysfunction,  or  disorders associated with hypoxemia.

# ■ ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSMS

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is commonly ≥ 3.0 cm in diameter and can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic aneurysms and those ≥ 5.0 cm in diameter frequently require prompt operative repair.

# Clinical Features

An acute rupturing AAA is an emergent condition that will lead to death if not rapidly identified and repaired. The classically described presentation of a ruptured AAA is an older male smoker with atherosclerosis who presents with sudden severe back or abdominal pain, hypotension, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Patients may also present with syncope or pain that localizes to the flank, groin, hip, or abdomen.

Half of patients with a rupturing aneurysm describe a ripping or tearing pain that is severe and abrupt in onset. On examination, patients may have a tender pulsatile abdominal mass, although this finding may be challenging to identify in obese patients. Patients with a ruptured AAA may present with persistent hypotension due to blood loss, although this may transiently improve due to  compensatory  mechanisms.  Femoral  pulsations  are  typically normal. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage may rarely present with external findings such as periumbilical ecchymosis (Cullen's sign), flank ecchymosis (Grey-Turner's sign), or a scrotal hematoma.

Aortoenteric  fistulas,  although  rare,  may  present  as  gastrointestinal bleeding  with  either  a  small  sentinel  bleed  or  a  massive  life-threatening hemorrhage. Patients with prior aortic grafting are at an increased risk of this complication. The duodenum is a common site for fistula formation, and patients with this complication may present with hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. Aortovenous fistulas can lead to high-output cardiac failure with decreased arterial blood flow distal to the fistula.

An uncommon presentation of AAA is rupture into the retroperitoneum, where significant fibrosis may lead to a chronic contained rupture. These patients can appear well and may complain of pain for an extended period of time before the diagnosis is made.

Clinicians may discover an asymptomatic AAA on physical examination or as an incidental finding on a radiologic study. Refer patients with a newly diagnosed AAA to a vascular surgeon for evaluation, keeping in mind that aneurysms larger than 5 cm in diameter are at a greater risk for rupture.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Identifying a new AAA can be a challenging diagnosis. When the diagnosis is not initially identified, renal colic is the most common incorrect initial diagnosis. Consider this diagnosis in patients with symptoms of back pain, an intraabdominal process, testicular torsion, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

181

--- Page 202 ---

182

SECTION 4: Cardiovascular Diseases

When the  diagnosis  is  unclear,  consider  additional  studies  to  further evaluate patients with symptoms concerning for an expanding or rupturing AAA. Bedside abdominal ultrasound has > 90% sensitivity for identifying AAA and can be used to accurately measure the diameter of the aneurysm (see Fig. 27-1), although aortic rupture or retroperitoneal bleed cannot be reliably  identified  with  this  modality.  Computed  tomography  (CT)  can identify AAA and delineate the anatomic details of the aneurysm and any associated rupture. The role of plain radiography in the diagnosis of rupturing AAA is unclear, as a calcified, bulging aortic contour is present in only 65% of patients with a symptomatic AAA.

# ■ AORTIC DISSECTION

# Clinical Features

Aortic  dissection  occurs  when  blood  dissects  between  the  intimal  and adventitial layers of the aorta, and classically presents with acute chest pain that is most severe at onset and radiates to the back. The location of the pain may indicate the area of the aorta that is involved. Sixty percent of patients with dissection of the ascending aorta have anterior chest pain, and involvement of the descending aorta may cause abdominal or back pain. The pain pattern may change as the dissection progresses from one anatomic area to another. The pain is most commonly described as sharp, ripping, or tearing pain. Syncope can occur in 10% of patients.

Most patients with aortic dissection are male (66%), older than 50 years, and have a history of hypertension. Chronic cocaine use and prior cardiac surgery are additional risk factors. Younger patients with identifiable risk factors  such  as  connective  tissue  disorders,  congenital  heart  disease,  and pregnancy are also at risk. Up to 30% of patients with Marfan's syndrome will develop a dissection. Iatrogenic aortic dissection may occur after aortic catheterization or cardiac surgery.

The Stanford classification  divides  dissections  into  those  that  involve the ascending aorta (type A) and those that are restricted to the descending aorta  (type  B). The  DeBakey classification divides dissections into three groups:  involvement  of  the  ascending  and  descending  aortas  (type  I), involvement of only the ascending aorta (type II), or involvement of only the descending aorta (type III).

As an aortic dissection progresses, seemingly unrelated symptom complexes may present themselves. Presentations include aortic valve insufficiency,  coronary  artery  occlusion  with  myocardial  infarction,  carotid involvement  with  stroke  symptoms,  occlusion  of  vertebral  blood  supply with paraplegia, cardiac tamponade with shock and jugular venous distention, compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve with hoarseness of the voice, and compression of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion with Horner's syndrome.

Findings on physical examination will depend on the location and progression of the dissection. A diastolic murmur of aortic insufficiency may be heard. Hypertension and tachycardia are common, but hypotension also may be present. Fifty percent of patients have decreased pulsation in the radial,  femoral,  or  carotid  arteries,  although  no  specific  threshold  values have been defined for blood pressure differences in extremities. Forty percent of patients have neurologic sequelae.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  differential  diagnosis  to  be  considered  depends  on  the  location  and progression of the dissection, but may include myocardial infarction, pericardial disease, stroke, spinal cord disorders, and primary conditions causing abdominal, back, or chest pain.

d-dimer testing is one of several biomarkers that have been investigated for potential utility in identifying or excluding dissection. No current guideline  endorses  the  use  of  d-dimer  as  the  sole  means  for  excluding  aortic dissection, partially due to a false-negative rate as high as 18%.

--- Page 205 ---

CHAPTER 27: Aortic Aneurysms and Aortic Dissection

185

The diagnosis of aortic dissection depends on radiographic confirmation. The most commonly found abnormalities on chest x-ray are an abnormal aortic contour and widening of the mediastinum, while other findings  may  include  deviation  of  the  trachea,  mainstem  bronchi,  or esophagus, apical capping, pleural effusion, or displacement of aortic intimal  calcifications.  The  chest  x-ray  is  normal  in  12%  to  37%  of patients with aortic dissection. CT scan with IV contrast is the imaging modality of choice and can reliably detect a false lumen as well as help to  identify  the  extent  of  the  dissection  including  extension  into  other vessels (see Fig. 27-2). Transesophageal echocardiograms are 97% to 100% sensitive and 97% to 99% specific. The preferential use of these studies may  be  institutionally dependent,  and  clinicians should coordinate  diagnostic  testing  with  the  consulting  vascular  or  thoracic surgeon.

# Arterial Occlusion

Carolyn K. Synovitz

Peripheral arterial disease is defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of < 0.9 (see ABI definition below). The disease prevalence is 4.3% in Americans  under  age  40  years,  and  prevalence  climbs  to  15.5%  in  those  over 70 years of age. High-risk individuals (such as those over 70 years, or those over 50 years with risk factors such as diabetes) should be evaluated carefully when complaints are indicative of possible occlusive arterial disease. Tobacco use significantly increases the risks that an individual will develop peripheral arterial disease. Limb ischemia from an acute arterial occlusion can lead to irreversible changes in peripheral nerves and skeletal muscle tissue in 4 to 6 hours. The most frequently diseased arteries leading to limb ischemia  are  the  femoropopliteal,  tibial,  aortoiliac,  and  brachiocephalic. The common femoral and popliteal arteries are the most common sites of arterial embolism.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Patients with acute arterial limb ischemia typically present with one or more of the 'six Ps': pain, pallor, poikilothermia (coldness), pulselessness, paresthesias, and paralysis. Pain is the earliest symptom and may increase with elevation of the limb. Changes in skin color with mottling, splotchiness,  and  cool  temperature  are  common.  Patients  may  present with muscle weakness as one early sign of limb ischemia, and the presence of acute anesthesia progressing to paralysis is concerning for acute ischemia that may negatively impact limb viability. A decreased pulse palpated distal to a vascular obstruction is an unreliable finding for early ischemia, especially in patients with chronic peripheral vascular disease and  well-developed  collateral  circulation.  Claudication  is  a  cramping pain, ache, or tiredness in an ischemic limb that is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest. It is reproducible, resolves within 2 to 5 minutes of rest, and reoccurs at consistent walking distances. Claudication is  a  classically  described  symptom  of  peripheral  vascular  disease,  but may only be present in 20% to 30% of patients with significant disease. These symptoms are contrasted with the pain of an acute episode of limb ischemia which is not well localized, is unrelieved by rest or gravity, and can  present  as  a  worsening  of  chronic  pain  when  caused  by  an  acute thrombotic event.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Although  thromboembolic  disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  acute arterial  occlusion,  the  differential  diagnosis  for  some  of  the  presenting symptoms may include catheterization complications, vasculitis, Raynaud disease, thromboangiitis obliterans, blunt or penetrating trauma, or lowflow  shock  states  such  as  sepsis.  Vasospasm  caused  by  intentional  or accidental  intraarterial  drug  injections  may  present  as  acute  ischemic

digits. Most commonly, a history of an abruptly ischemic limb in a patient with atrial fibrillation or recent myocardial infarction is strongly suggestive of an embolus. A history of chronic claudication suggests the presence of peripheral vascular disease, and an acute episode is likely caused by  thrombosis  and  worsening  limb  ischemia.  Examine  the  patient  for differences in peripheral pulses, capillary refill, and skin findings on the extremities.

Objective bedside testing with a handheld Doppler can document the presence or absence of blood flow in an affected limb. Duplex ultrasonography can further be used to detect an obstruction to flow with sensitivity greater than 85%. In addition, the ABI can be easily measured in the emergency department using a blood pressure cuff and Doppler ultrasound to measure the systolic pressure of occlusion at the brachial artery and posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis arteries. The ABI is the leg occlusion pressure divided  by  the  arm  occlusion  pressure  and  a  normal  ABI  is > 0.9.  An abnormal ABI suggests peripheral vascular disease, and a ratio lower than 0.41:1 is concerning for critical limb ischemia. A CT angiogram is a diagnostic  option  that  can  be  helpful  in  identifying  the  lesion  location  if  the limb does not show signs of critical ischemia. The diagnostic gold standard is  an  arteriogram,  which  can  define  the  anatomy  of  the  obstruction  and direct treatment of the limb.

# Pulmonary Emergencies

# Respiratory Distress

Baruch S. Fertel

The term respiratory distress includes both symptoms of dyspnea and signs indicating  difficulty  breathing.  The  cause  of  respiratory  distress  is  often multifactorial and may include the findings of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and cyanosis.

# ■ DYSPNEA

Dyspnea  is  the  subjective  feeling  of  difficult,  labored,  or  uncomfortable breathing. There is no single pathophysiologic mechanism that causes dyspnea and its etiology may be secondary to pulmonary, cardiac, or neurological dysfunction.

# Clinical Features

The  initial  assessment  of  any  patient  with  dyspnea  should  be  directed toward  identifying  respiratory  failure,  which  requires  more  immediate action. Dyspnea alone is a subjective complaint often difficult to quantify; therefore, objective findings are often needed to aid in diagnosis. Assess for signs  of  impending  respiratory  failure  which  include  tachycardia,  tachypnea, stridor, the use of accessory respiratory muscles (intercostals, sternocleidomastoid),  stridor,  lethargy,  agitation,  altered  mental  status,  and inability  to  speak  due  to  breathlessness.  If  present,  oxygen  should  be administered  immediately.  Early  use  of  noninvasive  ventilation  is  often helpful in reversing the downward trajectory, although the need for aggressive airway management and mechanical ventilation should be anticipated. Lesser degrees of distress allow for a more detailed approach.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The history and physical examination, together with ancillary testing, will help identify the etiology of dyspnea (Table 29-1).

It  can  be  challenging  to  differentiate  cardiac  (CHF)  and  pulmonary causes. Signs such as an S 3 gallop, edema, jugular venous distention, a history  of  orthopnea,  an  elevated  brain  natriuretic  peptide  (BNP),  or troponin  and  chest  radiograph  findings  of  edema  and  cardiomegaly  may point to cardiac causes. Pulse oximetry is a rapid but insensitive screen for

disorders of gas exchange as it may be falsely elevated as in methemoglobinemia. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis is more sensitive, detects both hypoxia and hypercarbia, and is useful for identifying metabolic causes, such  as  acidosis  with  compensatory  tachypnea,  but  does  not  take  into account work of breathing and fatigue. A peak expiratory flow rate may indicate reactive airway disease and a negative inspiratory force (NIF) may identify neurological causes of dyspnea. Additional ancillary tests that may prove helpful include a complete blood count to look for anemia, d-dimer assay when used with clinical decision rules to look for pulmonary embolus (PE),  chest  radiograph,  electrocardiogram,  and  computed  tomography  of the chest. Bedside cardiopulmonary ultrasound is increasingly being used to  look  for  pneumothorax,  tamponade,  pulmonary  consolidation  or  effusion, right heart strain suggesting PE, and congestive heart failure.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ HYPOXIA AND HYPOXEMIA

Hypoxia is the insufficient delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen delivery is a function of cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, and oxygen saturation.  Hypoxemia  is  defined  as  a  PaO 2 below  60  mm  Hg.  While hypoxia is  often  the  result  of  hypoxemia,  these  two  terms  are  not  interchangeable and one can occur without the other. Hypoxemia results from a

--- Page 213 ---

CHAPTER 29: Respiratory Distress

193

combination of five distinct mechanisms: (a) hypoventilation in which lack of ventilation increases PaCO 2 , thereby displacing oxygen from the alveolus and lowering the amount delivered to the alveolar capillaries; (b) rightto-left  shunt  in  which  blood  bypasses  the  lungs,  thereby  increasing  the amount of unoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation; (c) ventilation/perfusion mismatch in which areas of the lung are perfused but not ventilated; (d) diffusion impairment in which alveolar-blood barrier abnormality  causes  impairment  of  oxygenation;  and  (e)  low  inspired  oxygen, such as that occurs at high altitude.

# Clinical Features

Signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoxemia  are  nonspecific.  Acute  physiologic responses  to  hypoxemia  include  pulmonary  arterial  vasoconstriction  and increases in minute ventilation and sympathetic tone manifesting as tachypnea, tachycardia, and an initial hyperdynamic cardiac state. The predominant features are often neurologic, and may include headache, somnolence, lethargy, anxiety, agitation, coma, or seizures. Chronic hypoxemia may result in polycythemia, digital clubbing, cor pulmonale, and changes in body habitus (e.g., pulmonary cachexia or barreled chest of COPD). Cyanosis may be present but is not a sensitive or specific indicator of hypoxemia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A formal diagnosis of hypoxemia requires ABG analysis; however, pulse oximetry may be useful for gross abnormalities or trends. Hypoxemia may be quantified, and clues to its etiology may be obtained, by calculation of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient ('A-a gradient,' where the capital 'A' represents alveolar oxygen tension and 'a' indicates arterial oxygen level). The formula for calculating A-a gradient while breathing room air at sea level is

The A-a gradient is increased in cases of right-to-left shunts, ventilation-perfusion  mismatch,  and  diffusion  impairment.  The  normal  value for a 20-year-old seated upright and healthy nonsmoker is 5 to 10; the upper limit of normal increases by 1 for each decade of life. Patients with shunt will often not respond to supplemental oxygen while those with VQ mismatch, diffusion impairment, low inspired oxygen will improve their Pa0 2 .

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Regardless of the specific cause of hypoxemia, the initial approach remains the same. The following are general treatment guidelines for hypoxia:

--- Page 214 ---

194 SECTION 5: Pulmonary Emergencies

# ■ HYPERCAPNIA

Hypercapnia occurs exclusively due to alveolar hypoventilation (releasing of  CO 2 )  and  is  defined  as  a  PaCO 2 above  45  mm Hg.  Factors  that  affect alveolar ventilation include respiratory rate, tidal volume, and dead space volume, all of which are controlled by the body to maintain PaCO 2 in  a narrow range.

# Clinical Features

The signs and symptoms of hypercapnia depend on the absolute value of the PaCO 2 and the rate of change. Acute elevations result in increased intracranial pressure, prompting patient complaints of headache, confusion, and lethargy. Coma, encephalopathy, and seizures may occur when the PaCO 2 acutely rises above 80 mm Hg; similar PaCO 2 levels may be well tolerated if elevations are chronic.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of hypercapnia requires clinical suspicion and ABG analysis as pulse oximetry may be completely normal. In acute cases, the ABG will demonstrate an elevation in PaCO 2 with a respiratory acidosis and minimal metabolic compensation. Common causes of hypercapnia include COPD, respiratory center depression from drugs (e.g., opiates, sedatives, and anesthetics),  neuromuscular  impairment  from  disease  (e.g.,  Guillain-Barré syndrome)  or  toxin  (e.g.,  botulism),  and  finally  thoracic  cage  disorders (e.g., morbid obesity, kyphoscoliosis).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of acute hypercapnia requires aggressive measures to increase minute ventilation.

# ■ WHEEZING

Wheezes  are  'musical'  adventitious  lung  sounds  produced  by  airflow through  the  central  and  distal  airways.  It  is  usually  more  prominent  on exhalation,  in  contrast  to  upper  airway  stridor  which  is  more  prominent during inspiration, but it may be difficult to tell the two apart.

Wheezing  is  usually  associated  with  lower  airway  disease  such  as asthma or other obstructive pulmonary diseases; however, the differential

--- Page 215 ---

CHAPTER 29: Respiratory Distress

195

is broad and may also include pulmonary edema (commonly referred to as 'cardiac asthma'), foreign body, bronchiolitis, and other pathologies.

# ■ COUGH

Cough is a protective reflex for clearing secretions and foreign debris from the  tracheobronchial tree. Coughing is initiated by stimulation of irritant receptors  located  throughout  the  respiratory  tract.  Such  irritants  may include inflammation as in asthma, irritants such as mold or dust or pulmonary secretions.

# Clinical Features

Acute cough ( < 3 weeks) is most often caused by infection of the respiratory tract, or allergic reactions. Common upper respiratory infections are associated  with  a  combination  of  rhinorrhea,  sinusitis,  pharyngitis,  and laryngitis, with the cough a result of drainage from the nasopharynx onto cough receptors in the pharynx and larynx. A productive cough is the hallmark of acute bronchitis. Pertussis may last 1 to 6 weeks. A subacute cough may last for 3 to 8 weeks and is often post-infectious and related to airway inflammation and secretions.

The  most  common  cause  of  a  chronic  cough  lasting  more  than 6  weeks  is  smoking.  Features  of  smoking-related  cough  include  peak severity in the morning and sputum production. Other causes of chronic cough  include  upper  airway  cough  syndrome  (formerly  postnasal  discharge) which is associated with mucus drainage from the nose, a history of 'allergies or sinus problems,' and frequent clearing of the throat or swallowing of mucus. Asthma-related chronic cough is often worse at night,  exacerbated  by  irritants,  and  associated  with  episodic  wheezing and dyspnea. Gastroesophageal reflux-related cough often has a history of  heartburn,  is  worse  when  lying  down,  and  improves  with  anti-acid therapy (e.g., antacids, H 2 blockers, or proton pump blockers). Angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitor  or  angiotensin  II  receptor blocker (ARB) therapy cough is highly variable in onset, severity, and variation during the day and can begin as early as 1 week to as late as 1 year after starting treatment. The cough is dry and typically resolves in 1 to 4 weeks after ACE or ARB therapy is stopped but may linger for up to 3 months.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Obtain a chest radiograph in patients with purulent sputum and/or fever. Use spirometry to document the presence of airflow obstruction in patients with asthma. In both children and adults, acute coughing illnesses can last up to 3 weeks and appropriate guidance should be given.

In addition to disease-specific therapy, patients with acute cough may benefit  from  symptomatic  treatment  with  antitussives,  which  block  the cough reflex at various locations, or demulcents, which soothe the pharynx and somewhat suppress the cough reflex. For intractable coughing paroxysms in the ED, nebulized lidocaine may provide relief.

Figure 29-1 outlines a sequential approach for evaluation of subacute and chronic cough.

# ■ HICCUPS

Hiccups are the involuntary spastic contraction of the inspiratory muscles.

# Clinical Features

Benign  hiccups  are  generally  initiated  by  gastric  distention  from  food  or drink, especially carbonated beverages or alcohol. Persistent hiccups are usually the result of injury or irritation to a branch of the vagus or phrenic nerves.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Determine whether a specific triggering event exists. Ask about the relationship with sleep; if there is resolution during sleep it suggests a psychogenic  cause.  Consider  obtaining  a  chest  radiograph  to  evaluate  for intrathoracic pathology.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

There are various physical maneuvers and drugs that can be used to terminate an acute episode.

--- Page 217 ---

CHAPTER 29: Respiratory Distress 197

Chlorpromazine is the only drug with FDA approval for hiccups though metoclopramide and haloperidol have also been used.

# ■ CYANOSIS

Cyanosis is a bluish color of the skin or mucous membranes, resulting from an increased amount of deoxyhemoglobin (reduced Hb). The detection of cyanosis is highly subjective and not a sensitive indicator of arterial oxygenation.  It  is  usually  visible  when  the  deoxyhemoglobin  level  exceeds 5 mg/dL.

# Clinical Features

The presence of cyanosis suggests tissue hypoxia. Cyanosis is divided into central and peripheral categories. Central cyanosis, which is most reliably observed under the tongue or on the buccal mucosa, is due to inadequate pulmonary oxygenation or abnormal hemoglobin such as methemoglobin and peripheral cyanosis of the fingers or extremities is due to diminished peripheral blood flow.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The causes of cyanosis may be multifactorial (Table 29-2). In some cases, diagnosis  is  confounded  by  the  coexistence  of  central  and  peripheral cyanosis.  Pulse  oximetry  is  easily  available  for  continuous  monitoring but may be inaccurate in the presence of a hemaglobinopathy. Obtain an ABG analysis with co-oximetry as ABG alone may also be misleading in the presence of a hemaglobinopathy. For example, methemoglobinemia and  carboxyhemoglobinemia  may  cause  cyanosis  with  a  normal  PaO 2 . Methemoglobinemia is associated with blood that has been described as chocolate brown, and which does not change color with exposure to room air. An extremely elevated carboxyhemoglobin level may produce cherryred  mucous  membrane  discoloration.  A  hematocrit  may  demonstrate polycythemia  vera  or  severe  anemia,  both  of  which  may  contribute  to cyanosis.

# ■ PLEURAL EFFUSION

Pleural  effusions  result  from  fluid  accumulating  in  the  potential  space between the visceral and parietal pleurae.

# Clinical Features

A pleural effusion may be clinically silent or symptomatic, due to symptoms of an underlying disease, an increase in volume of the effusion with the production of dyspnea, or the development of inflammation and associated pain with respiration. Physical findings of a pleural effusion include percussion dullness and decreased breath sounds.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The underlying etiologies of pleural effusion are numerous. In developed countries, the most common causes are heart failure, pneumonia, and cancer.  The  presence  of  pleural  effusion  on  chest  radiograph  or  ultrasound should prompt a search for the underlying cause.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Thoracentesis  may  be  performed  for  diagnostic  purposes  to  differentiate between an exudate and transudate or to identify infection. It may also be performed for therapeutic purposes if a patient has dyspnea at rest. Typically 1-1.5 L are removed; more may precipitate re-expansion pulmonary edema.

The  management  of  parapneumonic  effusions  and  empyemas  may include antibiotics to target the underlying infectious agent and the placement  of  a  thoracostomy  tube.  The  decision  to  admit  should  take  into account the acuity and severity of symptoms.

--- Page 219 ---

# ■ BRONCHITIS

Acute bronchitis is a commonly encountered, self-limited, infection producing inflammatory changes within the larger airways. Sharing the viral pathogens of upper respiratory infections, including those of the common cold, acute bronchitis is often caused by one of the following: influenza A  or  B  virus,  adenovirus,  rhinovirus,  parainfluenza  virus,  respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus. Far less frequent in etiology, the bacterial pathogens Streptococcus  pneumoniae , Haemophilus  influenzae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae ,  and Bordatella pertussis may lead to more severe presentations in older populations, especially in those with increased comorbidities.

# Clinical Features

The predominant cough of acute bronchitis may be productive and can easily last up to 3 weeks. Sputum purulence is usually indicative of sloughed inflammatory airway cells and, taken alone, does not indicate a bacterial etiology.  Bronchitis  most  commonly  lacks  the  suggestive  symptoms  and signs of pneumonia, specifically fever > 38°C (100.4°F), adult heart rate > 100 beats/min, and/or adult respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min. Wheezing may be present.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis can be made clinically with the following criteria: (a) acute-onset cough (shorter than 3 weeks duration), (b) absence of chronic lung disease history, (c) normal vital signs, and (d) absence of auscultatory abnormalities that suggest pneumonia. Pulse oximetry is indicated if the patient describes dyspnea or appears short of breath. Bedside peak flow testing may reveal reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second.  A  chest  radiograph  is  not  required  in  non-elderly  patients  who appear nontoxic. Consider pertussis in adolescents and young adults whose coughs persist beyond 2 to 3 weeks, particularly if they exhibit coughing paroxysms with prominent post-tussive emesis or had exposure to pertussis.

# ■ pNeUMONIa

Pneumonia is most commonly a bacterial infection of the alveolar lung. Pneumococcus ( Streptococcus pneumoniae ) is the classic bacterial etiology, although incidence from atypical and opportunistic agents, particularly  if  pneumonia  is  acquired  in  health  care  settings,  is  increasing. Staphylococcus  aureus , Klebsiella  pneumoniae , Pseudomonas  aeruginosa ,  and Haemophilus  influenzae are  additional  causative  bacterial agents. Legionella  pneumophila , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , and a spectrum of respiratory viruses account for the bulk of atypical pneumonias. Anaerobes are less frequently encountered, but must  be  highly  suspected  if  aspiration  is  suspected.  Risk  factors  for pneumonia  are  multiple,  and  include  diseases  of  the  respiratory  tract (e.g.,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  or  COPD)  and  immune system  (e.g.,  cancer,  AIDS),  as  well  as  chronic  conditions  associated with aspiration, bacteremia, and debilitation.

# Clinical Features

Patients with undifferentiated bacterial pneumonia typically present with some combination of cough, fatigue, fever, dyspnea, sputum production, and pleuritic  chest  pain.  Physical  examination  often  reveals  tachypnea, tachycardia, low pulse oximetry, and the auscultatory findings of bronchial breath sounds and rhonchi suggestive of consolidation. Impaired air passage  may  be  indicated  by  wheezing.  While  historical  features  and associated symptoms and signs can prove helpful in predicting a likely causative  organism,  the  treatment  of  pneumonia  has  shifted  to  empiric treatment based on the patient's environment. The clinician should differentiate  between  community  acquired  pneumonia  (CAP)  versus  health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with HCAP's risk for organisms that require specific and/or broadened antibiotic coverage, such as Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and/or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA). Patients meeting criteria for HCAP include patients hospitalized over 48 hours within the prior 90 days, those receiving routine outpatient  treatments  of  dialysis,  chemotherapy,  wound  care,  or  home  IV antibiotic therapy, and residents of a nursing facility.

Clinical features of aspiration pneumonitis depend on the volume and pH of the aspirate, the presence of particulate matter in the aspirate, and bacterial  contamination.  Although  aspiration  of  acidic,  larger  volumes result in a relatively rapid onset of tachypnea, tachycardia, and respiratory

201

distress that may progress to pulmonary failure, most cases of aspiration pneumonia progress insidiously. While aspiration pneumonias may occur anywhere in  the  lung,  aspirated  material  has  a  predilection  for  the  right lower lobe due to gravity and tracheobronchial tree anatomy. Untreated or partially treated aspiration pneumonia may progress to empyema, defined as pus in the pleural space, or a lung abscess.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Uncomplicated  presentations  in  otherwise  healthy  patients  may  not require  use  of  radiology,  laboratory,  or  pathology  resources;  however, chest radiography is most commonly used for diagnosis (see Fig. 30-1). Depending upon the anticipated etiology and disposition course, assessing  white  blood  count  with  differential  analysis,  serum  electrolytes, blood  urea  nitrogen,  creatinine,  glucose,  blood  gases,  sputum  Gram staining, and cultures of sputum and blood provide benefit, particularly in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Most patients do not require identification of a specific organism to make a diagnosis and begin treatment.

The differential diagnosis of nontrauma patients with respiratory complaints and radiographic abnormality is lengthy and partially includes noninfectious atelectasis; chronic pulmonary fibrosis; pleural effusion; chemical pneumonitis; inflammatory disorders, such as sarcoidosis; neoplasm; postsurgical changes; tuberculosis; bronchiolitis obliterans; pulmonary embolus;

# ■ NOVeL ReSpIRaTORY INFeCTIONS

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) came to worldwide attention in the winter of 2003. Numerous deaths were reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. The etiologic agent is a coronavirus, SARS-CoV, spread by 'droplet infection.' In the event of SARS outbreak, up-to-date information can be found at the CDC website (http://www.cdc.gov/sars/who/clinicians .html) as well as at the World Health Organization (WHO) website (http:// www.who.int/topics/sars/en/).

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was named in latter 2012 and became a more prominent global concern in the spring of 2014. A fatality rate approaching 50% was reported in the initial 100 diagnosed cases. Since these initial cases, mortality has decreased. The etiologic agent is a coronavirus. Respiratory symptoms predominate, though GI symptoms of abdominal  pain  and  diarrhea  may  be  present.  Health  care  workers  exposed  via airborne transmission have become more common in case reports. Current, basic steps to reduce MERS coronavirus transmission to health care workers include  wearing  gloves,  gown,  eye  protection  and  using  a  fit-tested  N95 respirator  facemask.  Up-to-date  information  can  be  found  at  the  CDC website  (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/hcp.html)  as  well  as  at  the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/).

Tuberculosis (TB) is the second most common cause of infectious disease deaths globally, with one-third of the world's population infected. Although active  TB  infection  rates  continue  to  decline  in  the  United  States,  TB remains  an  important  public  health  problem,  particularly  among  immigrants,  whose  active  TB  case  rate  is  12  times  higher  than  the  US-born population. Other risk factors include HIV infection; living or working in prison,  shelters,  and  long-term  care  facilities;  and  alcohol/drug  abuse. Transmission occurs by inhalation of droplet nuclei and may lead to active primary infection or latent disease (which may reactivate later). Identifying and treating high-risk patients for active and latent TB is key to ongoing TB control.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

# Primary TB

Initial TB infection is usually asymptomatic in immune-competent adults, generally presenting with only a new positive reaction to TB skin testing (TST) or a new positive interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). These patients have normal chest radiographs (CXRs) and are presumed to have latent infections. When active primary TB does develop, symptoms often include fever, cough, weight loss, malaise, and chest pain. Some patients may  present  with  active  pneumonitis  (which  may  be  mistaken  for community-acquired pneumonia) or extra-pulmonary disease.

Children are more likely to present with active early disease, although the  presenting  symptoms may be subtle even when CXRs are abnormal. Presenting symptoms may include fever, cough, wheezing, poor feeding, and fatigue. TB meningitis and miliary TB are more common in children than adults.

Immunocompromised patients are much more likely to develop rapidly progressive  primary  infections.  All  patients  with  active  TB  should  be evaluated for immune-compromising conditions. Symptoms may be pulmonary (fever, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis) or extrapulmonary, reflecting early hematogenous spread to the liver, bones, central nervous system, or other sites.

# Reactivation TB

Latent TB infections will progress to active disease (i.e., reactivation TB) in 5% of cases within 2 years of primary infection; an additional 5% will reactivate over their lifetimes. Reactivation rates are higher in children, the elderly, persons with recent primary infection, those with immune compromise (in particular HIV), and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes and renal failure.

Most  patients  with  reactivation  TB  present  subacutely  with  fever, malaise, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats. Most patients with active

204

--- Page 225 ---

CHAPTER 31: Tuberculosis

205

TB  will  have  pulmonary  involvement  and  will  develop  productive coughs. Hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea may occur. Rales and rhonchi may be found, but the physical examination is not usually diagnostic.

Extrapulmonary TB develops in up to 20% of active TB cases. Lymphadenitis, with painless enlargement and possible draining sinuses, is a common  presentation.  Patients  may  also  present  with  symptomatic  pleural effusion, pericarditis, peritonitis, or meningitis. Additional sites of reactivation TB after hematogenous spread include bones, joints, adrenals, GI tract, and GU tract. Extrapulmonary reactivation TB is more common and often more severe in young children and immunocompromised patients as noted for primary TB infection above.

Miliary TB is a multisystem disease caused by massive hematogenous dissemination.  It  is  also  more  common  in  immunocompromised  patients and children. Symptoms are systemic with fever, weight loss, adenopathy, and malaise. Patients may present with multiorgan failure or  Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Variable presentations and limited testing options make TB diagnosis particularly challenging in the ED. Differential diagnoses may include other infectious  causes  of  pulmonary  and  extrapulmonary  lesions  as  well  as malignancy. TB should always be considered in patients with prolonged febrile  cough  illnesses,  particularly  in  known  risk  groups.  TB  should  be considered  in  any  HIV  patient  with  respiratory  symptoms,  even  if  chest radiographs are normal (see Chapter 92 HIV Infections and AIDS).

# Imaging

CXR remains the most useful ED diagnostic tool for TB. Active primary pulmonary TB usually presents with parenchymal infiltrates in any lung area. Hilar and/or mediastinal adenopathy may occur with or without infiltrates. Effusions, usually unilateral, may be seen with or without infiltrates.

Reactivation TB classically presents with lesions in the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes (Fig. 31-1). Cavitation, calcification, scarring, atelectasis, hilar adenopathy, and effusions may be seen. Cavitation is associated with increased infectivity. Miliary TB may cause diffuse, small  (1  to  3  mm)  nodular  infiltrates.  Atypical  CXRs  are  progressively more common with worsening immune compromise. Patients co-infected with HIV and TB are particularly likely to present with atypical imaging.

Stable scarring, volume loss, and calcified or noncalcified nodules may be found (often as incidental findings) in patients with asymptomatic latent TB infection; these patients are not infectious and do not require urgent treatment or isolation. Comparison with prior films is useful in determining the likelihood of active TB infection.

# Laboratory Tests

Acid-fast  staining of  sputum  can  detect  mycobacteria  in  many  patients with pulmonary TB, although the yield is lower in HIV patients. Results may be available within several hours, with potential ED utility, but there

--- Page 226 ---

206

SECTION 5: Pulmonary Emergencies

are serious limitations. Many patients will have false negatives on a single sputum  sample.  Microscopy  of  nonsputum  samples  (e.g.,  pleural  fluid, cerebrospinal fluid) is even less sensitive. Microscopy cannot differentiate between  TB  and  nontuberculous  mycobacteria. Culture of  sputum  (or other specimens) is the gold standard for diagnosing active TB. Unfortunately, definitive culture results take weeks. When available, newer technologies such as TB-specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can produce results within 24 hours, a time frame potentially useful in ED management. These tests have poor negative predictive value, but a patient with positive microscopy and a positive NAAT should be treated for active TB unless subsequent cultures rule it out.

Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) identify most patients with latent, prior, or active TB, but results are read 48 to 72 hours after placement, limiting the ED utility of this approach. Patients with disseminated TB, early active TB,  or  major  immune  compromise  (especially  HIV)  may  have  falsenegative TSTs. Immigrants who received BCG vaccine in childhood may have  false-positive TSTs. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) of whole blood may become more useful than TST for ED evaluation of suspected TB, since these tests may be resulted within hours and may have better  sensitivity  and  specificity  in  some  situations.  For  instance,  BCG

alone should not cause a positive IGRA, making it useful for evaluating immigrants from high-prevalence countries.

Pneumothorax occurs when air or gas enters the pleural cavity, the potential  space  between  the  visceral  and  parietal  pleura,  leading  to  partial lung collapse.  Smoking is the most common risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax.

Primary pneumothorax occurs in patients without known lung disease and secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of known lung disease, such  as  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  asthma,  cystic  fibrosis, interstitial  lung  disease,  infection,  connective  tissue  disease,  and  cancer. Latrogenic pneumothorax occurs secondary to invasive procedures such as needle biopsy of the lung, placement of a subclavian line, nasogastric tube placement or positive pressure ventilation, Tension pneumothorax results from  positive  pressure  in  the  pleural  space  leading  to  decreased  venous return, hypotension, and hypoxia. Hemopneumothorax occurs in 2% to 7% of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Treating the underlying disease may help decrease the risk of pneumothorax.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Sudden-onset dyspnea and ipsilateral, pleuritic chest pain are the most common  presenting  symptoms.  The  physical  examination  findings  are  often subtle. Sinus tachycardia is the most common physical finding. In spontaneous pneumothorax the classic examination findings of ipsilateral decreased breath sounds, reduced chest expansion, and hyperresonance to percussion are often  absent.  However,  in  traumatic  pneumothorax,  the  positive  predictive value of ipsilateral decreased breath sounds is 86% to 97%. Clinical hallmarks of  tension  pneumothorax  include  severe  progressive  dyspnea,  tachycardia ( > 140  bpm),  hypoxia,  and  ipsilateral  decreased  breath  sounds.  Tracheal deviations  away  from  the  affected  side,  distended  neck  veins,  and  cardiac apical displacement are late and infrequent signs of progressive tension.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Pneumothorax is an important differential consideration in patients with pleuritic chest pain, especially in those with underlying lung disease. Patients with pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pericarditis, pleural effusions, or shingles can present with pain similar to those with pneumothorax. As clinical signs and symptoms are often subtle and variable, the definitive diagnosis is usually established with appropriate imaging. In stable patients with suspected pneumothorax,  an  erect  posteroanterior  (PA)  chest  radiograph  is  usually  the primary investigation. Characteristically this demonstrates a displaced pleural line with absent lung markings extending from the visceral pleura (lung edge) to  the  chest  wall  (parietal  pleura).  Routine  expiratory  radiographs  do  not significantly enhance diagnostic yield. The presence of cardiophrenic recess hyperlucency  and  costophrenic  angle  enlargement  (deep  sulcus  sign)  on  a supine anteroposterior radiograph is suggestive of pneumothorax.

208

CHAPTER 32: Spontaneous and Iatrogenic Pneumothorax

209

Large emphysematous bullae may mimic pneumothorax. To prevent the potentially  disastrous  consequence  of  inserting  a  chest  drain  into  a  lung bulla mistaken for a pneumothorax, thoracic computed tomography (CT) should be used to clarify the diagnosis. Bedside ultrasound is a rapid, noninvasive method to diagnose pneumothorax in young, healthy patients with no underlying lung disease.

In normal lung, the visceral and parietal pleura are in direct contact and ultrasound  can  be  used  to  demonstrate  the  lung  moving  back  and  forth beneath the ribs during respiration (lung sliding), and vertical reverberation artefacts (comet-tails). Features suggesting pneumothorax include absence of lung sliding, comet tail artefacts and a lung pulse in the presence of a distinct A lines and visualized lung point. Chest CT is effective at detecting pneumothorax, determining their size and volume, and detecting other lung pathology, and can differentiate large bullae from intrapleural air.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The ED treatment goal is the elimination of intrapleural air.

# ■ TREATMENT COMpLICATIONS

Intervention  complications  include  intercostal  vessel  hemorrhage,  lung parenchymal injury, empyema, and tube malfunction (development of an air leak or tension pneumothorax), and re-expansion lung injury. Re-expansion lung injury is uncommon and seen more often when there is collapse of the lung for greater than 72 hours, large pneumothoraces, rapid re-expansion, or negative pleural pressure suction of greater than 20 cm. Most patients with re-expansion injury require only observation and supplemental oxygen and rarely suffer adverse outcomes.

# Iatrogenic Pneumothorax

Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a subset of traumatic pneumothorax and occurs more often than spontaneous pneumothorax. Transthoracic needle procedures  (needle  biopsy  and  thoracentesis)  account  for  50%  of  iatrogenic pneumothoraces with subclavian vein catheterization accounting for a further 25%. US guidance for central venous catheter insertion for thoracentesis  reduces  the  pneumothorax  complication  rate.  Factors  associated  with the  increasing  frequency  of  iatrogenic  pneumothorax  include  underlying disease, body habitus, and experience of the operator. Although it is routine to  obtain  a  chest  radiograph  after  central  line  placement  or  transthoracic needle procedures, chest radiograph may not identify a pneumothorax if the patient  is  supine  or  if  there  is  inadequate  time  for  the  pneumothorax  to develop, with up to one-third detected later. Treatment for iatrogenic pneumothorax is generally the same as for spontaneous pneumothorax.

Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the lungs or tracheobronchial tree. Massive hemoptysis is defined as 100 mL of blood per 24 hours up  to > 1000  mL  per  24  hours.  Minor  hemoptysis  is  defined  as  the production of smaller quantities of blood in a patient with no comorbid lung disease and stable vital signs. Hemoptysis results from the disruption  of  blood  vessels  within  the  bronchial  circulation  which  supplies oxygenated blood to the bronchi, bronchioles, and lung parenchyma.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Hemoptysis  may  be  the  presenting  symptom  for  many  different  diseases. Massive  hemoptysis  can  often  be  life  threatening.  A  careful  history  and physical  can  raise  suspicion  for  the  underlying  diagnosis  and  guide  the appropriate  workup. The  acute  onset  of  fever,  cough,  and  bloody  sputum may indicate  pneumonia  or  bronchitis. An  indolent  productive  cough  can indicate bronchitis or bronchiectasis. Dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain are potential indicators of pulmonary embolism, particularly in the presence of venous thromboembolic risk factors. Tuberculosis should be considered in the setting of fever, night sweats, and risk factors such as travel from endemic regions.  Bronchogenic  carcinoma  may  present  with  tobacco  use,  chronic weight loss, and a change in cough. Chronic dyspnea and minor hemoptysis may indicate mitral stenosis or alveolar hemorrhage syndromes (most commonly seen in patients with renal disease). Consider Goodpasture's syndrome in patients with hemoptysis, hematuria, and renal insufficiency.

The physical examination should begin with an assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation, with a focus on the vital signs. Common abnormal vital signs include fever and tachypnea. Tachypnea may be a sign of respiratory compromise with hypoxemia. Hypotension is an ominous sign, usually  seen  only  in  massive  hemoptysis.  The  cardiac  examination  may reveal signs of valvular heart disease (e.g., the diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis). The nasal and oral cavities should be inspected carefully to help rule out an extrapulmonary source of bleeding (pseudohemoptysis).

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

A  careful  history  and  physical  examination  may  suggest  a  diagnosis, although the cause of hemoptysis is undetermined in up to 30% of cases. Pulse oximetry and a chest x-ray (PA and lateral, if the patient's condition allows) are always indicated. Other tests that may be helpful include arterial blood gas, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, platelet count, coagulation studies, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram. Chest CT should be considered if there is hemoptysis with an abnormal chest radiograph or if considering pulmonary embolism or carcinoma on the differential diagnosis. The long differential  diagnosis  list  includes  infectious,  neoplastic,  and  cardiac etiologies. Infectious etiologies include bronchitis, bronchiectasis, bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis, fungal pneumonia, and lung abscess.

211

212 SECTION 5: Pulmonary Emergencies

Neoplastic  etiologies  include  bronchogenic  carcinoma  and  bronchial adenoma. Cardiogenic etiologies include mitral stenosis and left ventricular failure. Trauma, foreign body aspiration, pulmonary embolism (hemoptysis is one of the Wells criteria), primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary vasculitis,  and  bleeding  diathesis,  and  coagulopathies  secondary  to medications are other potential causes.

# Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Stacey L. Poznanski

Although most asthmatic attacks are mild and reversible, severe attacks can be fatal and many patients develop chronic airflow limitation from permanent airway remodeling. Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the world. COPD is the only major cause of death that is increasing in frequency, a phenomenon attributed to tobacco abuse. The prevalence has been stable in men, whereas the prevalence in women has doubled in  the  past  few  decades  and  women  now  account  for > 50% of COPD-related deaths.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with hyperresponsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree and a continuum of acute bronchospasm  and  airway  inflammation.  COPD  has  two  dominant  forms:  (a) pulmonary emphysema, defined in terms of anatomic pathology, characterized by destruction of bronchioles and alveoli and (b) chronic bronchitis, defined in clinical terms as a condition of excess mucous secretion in the bronchial tree, with a chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of two consecutive  years.  The  World  Health  Organization's  Global  Institute  for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease definition of COPD encompasses both these forms as well as bronchiectasis, and asthma, and recognizes that most patients have a combination.

Acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD are usually associated with a trigger, such as smoking, respiratory infections, exposure to noxious stimuli (e.g.,  pollutants,  cold,  stress,  antigens,  or  exercise),  adverse  response  to medications (e.g., decongestants, β -blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), allergic reactions, hormonal changes during the normal menstrual cycle or pregnancy, and noncompliance with prescribed therapies. Although asthma exacerbations are due to expiratory airflow limitations, acute exacerbations of COPD are primarily due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Classically, patients with exacerbations of asthma or COPD present with complaints of dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough. Risk factors for death from asthma exacerbation include past history of severe exacerbation, ≥ 2 hospitalizations or > 3 ED visits for asthma in the past year, > 2 canisters per month of inhaled short-acting β 2 agonist (SABA), low socioeconomic status or history of illicit drug use, or psychiatric disease. Physical  examination  shows  wheezing  with  prolonged  expiration.  Wheezing does not correlate with the degree of airflow obstruction; a 'quiet chest' may indicate severe airflow restriction. Patients with severe attacks may be sitting  upright  with  forward  posturing,  with  pursed-lip  exhalation,  accessory  muscle  use,  paradoxical  respirations,  and  diaphoresis.  Pulsus  paradoxus of 20 mm Hg or higher may be seen. Severe airflow obstruction and ventilation/perfusion  imbalance  can  cause  hypoxia  and  hypercapnia. Hypoxia is characterized by tachypnea, cyanosis, agitation, apprehension,

213

--- Page 234 ---

214 SECTION 5: Pulmonary Emergencies

tachycardia,  and  hypertension.  Signs  of  hypercapnia  include  confusion, tremor, plethora, stupor, hypopnea, and apnea. Impending respiratory failure  may  be  signaled  by  alteration  in  mental  status,  lethargy,  minimal  or absent breath sounds, acidosis, worsening hypoxia, and hypercapnia.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Emergency  department  diagnosis  of  asthma  or  COPD  usually  is  made clinically, although signs and symptoms do not always correlate well with severity of airflow obstruction. Severity can be measured more objectively by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and peak expiratory flow  rate  (PEFR)  in  cooperative  patients.  A  FEV 1 or  PEFR < 40%  of patients  predicted  in  asthmatics  indicates  a  severe  exacerbation.  Pulse oximetry is a fast, easy, and noninvasive means for assessing and monitoring  oxygen saturation  during  treatment,  but  it  does  not  aid  in  predicting clinical  outcomes  and  cannot  predict  hypercapnia  or  acidosis.  Arterial blood  gas  (ABG)  is  not  needed  in  most  patients  with  mild  to  moderate exacerbations  and  should  be  reserved  for  evaluation  of  hypercapnia  and acidosis in severe cases. Compensated hypercapnia and hypoxia is common in COPD patients; comparison with previous ABG values is helpful. Normal or elevated Paco 2 in the setting of an acute, severe asthmatic attack is an ominous finding as it indicates respiratory fatigue.

Asthma and COPD can coexist or be mistaken for one another; this is especially true in females. The immediate diagnostic challenge is separating these diagnoses from other serious respiratory emergencies. Important asthma and COPD mimickers include acute heart failure, upper airway obstruction, pulmonary  emboli,  aspiration,  endobronchial  obstruction/mass,  interstitial lung  disease,  and  vocal  cord  dysfunction.  Congestive  heart  failure  (CHF) commonly coexists or mimics COPD and can also cause wheezing. Chest x-ray, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and signs of fluid overload (jugular venous  distention  or  hepatojugular  reflux)  help  differentiate  COPD  from CHF. Chest x-ray can be used to diagnose complications such as pneumonia and pneumothorax, but is not routinely indicated in mild to moderate asthma exacerbations.  Electrocardiograms  are  useful  to  identify  dysrhythmias  or suspected ischemic injury in the appropriate patient population. A high index of suspicion is necessary to rule out pulmonary embolism.

# Gastrointestinal Emergencies

# Acute Abdominal Pain

Bryan E. Baskin

Acute abdominal pain may be due to numerous etiologies including gastrointestinal,  genitourinary,  cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  musculoskeletal, dermatologic, neurogenic, and other sources creating visceral, parietal, or referred pain to the abdomen.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Consider immediate life threats that might require emergency intervention. Elicit time of pain onset; character, severity, location of pain and its referral (Fig. 35-1); aggravating and alleviating factors; and similar prior episodes. Cardiorespiratory symptoms, such as chest pain, dyspnea, and cough; genitourinary symptoms, such as urgency, dysuria, and vaginal discharge; and any history of trauma should be elicited. In older patients it is also important to obtain a history of myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias,  coagulopathies,  and  vasculopathies.  Past  medical  and  surgical histories  should  be  elicited,  and  a  list  of  medications,  particularly steroids, antibiotics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should be noted. A thorough gynecologic history is indicated in female patients.

The physical examination should include the patient's general appearance. Patients with peritonitis tend to lie still. The skin should be evaluated for pallor, jaundice, or rash. The vital signs should be reviewed for signs of hypovolemia due to blood loss or volume depletion. Due to medications and/or the physiology of aging, elderly patients may not exhibit tachycardia in  the  face  of  hypovolemia  or  illness.  A  core  temperature  should  be obtained; however, absence of fever does not rule out infection, particularly in the elderly. The abdomen should be inspected for contour, scars, peristalsis, masses, distention, and pulsation. The presence of hyperactive or highpitched or tinkling bowel sounds increases the likelihood of small bowel obstruction.

Palpation is the most important aspect of the physical examination. The abdomen and genitals should be assessed for tenderness, guarding, masses,

6

218

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

organomegaly,  and  hernias.  Rebound  tenderness,  often  regarded  as  the clinical criterion standard of peritonitis, has several important limitations. In patients with peritonitis, the combination of rigidity, referred tenderness, and, especially, cough pain usually provides sufficient diagnostic confirmation; false-positive rebound tenderness occurs in about one patient out of four without peritonitis. This has led some investigators to conclude that rebound tenderness, in contrast to cough pain, is of no predictive value. A useful and underused test to diagnose abdominal wall pain is the sit-up test, also known as the Carnett sign . After identification of the site of maximum

--- Page 239 ---

CHAPTER 35: Acute Abdominal Pain

219

abdominal tenderness, the patient is asked to fold his or her arms across the chest and sit up halfway. The examiner maintains a finger on the tender area,  and  if  palpation  in  the  semisitting  position  produces  the  same  or increased tenderness, the test is said to be positive for an abdominal wall syndrome.

Perform a pelvic examination in all postpubertal females. During the rectal  examination,  the  lower  pelvis  should  be  assessed  for  tenderness, bleeding, and masses.

Elderly patients often fail to manifest the same signs and symptoms as  younger  patients,  with  decreased  pain  perception  and  decreased febrile or muscular response to infection or inflammation. This is similarly  true  of  diabetics  and  immunocompromised  patients.  Due  to  this, morbidity  and  mortality  of  elderly  patients  presenting  to  EDs  with abdominal pain are high. Biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis,  cancer,  and  hernia  are  more  common  causes  of  abdominal  pain  in patients over 50 years old. Hypotension from volume contraction, hemorrhage,  or  sepsis  can  be  missed  if  a  normally  hypertensive  patient appears normotensive. Conditions, somewhat less frequent but proportionately higher in occurrence, among the elderly include sigmoid volvulus,  diverticulitis,  acute  mesenteric  ischemia,  and  abdominal  aortic aneurysm.  Mesenteric  ischemia  should  be  considered  in  any  patient older than 50 years with abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Suggested laboratory studies for goal-directed clinical testing are listed in Table 35-1. All women of child-bearing age with abdominal pain and/or abnormal vaginal bleeding should receive a qualitative pregnancy test. A complete blood count is neither sensitive nor specific to identify abdominal pathology;  however,  it  remains  the  most  commonly  ordered  test  for  ED patients with abdominal pain.

Plain abdominal radiographs can be helpful in patients with suspected obstruction,  perforation  (looking  for  free  air),  or  to  follow  previously identified  stones  in  renal  colic  patients;  however,  in  general  have  low sensitivity. Ultrasonography is useful for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis,  cholecystitis,  biliary  duct  dilatation,  pancreatic masses, hydroureter or hydronephrosis, intrauterine or ectopic pregnancies, ovarian and tubal pathologies, free intraperitoneal fluid, suspected appendicitis (institution specific), and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Since ultrasound machines are portable, a bedside ultrasound can be performed quickly by an emergency provider. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the preferred imaging method for mesenteric ischemia, pancreatitis,  aortic  aneurysm,  appendicitis,  and  urolithiasis  and  is  superior  for identifying  virtually  any  abnormality  that  can  be  seen  on  plain  films. Intravenous contrast is essential to identify vascular lesions, is helpful to identify inflammatory conditions (i.e., appendicitis), but is not needed for urolithiasis. Oral contrast aids in the diagnosis of bowel obstruction, but otherwise is less useful.

# Nausea and Vomiting

Jonathan A. Maisel

Although nausea and vomiting are typically caused by gastrointestinal disorders, the clinician must consider systemic causes as well. Neurologic, infectious,  cardiac,  endocrine,  renal,  obstetric,  pharmacologic,  toxicologic,  and psychiatric disorders may all be the cause of nausea and vomiting. A comprehensive history and physical examination, as well as the use of various diagnostic modalities, are needed to determine the cause and its complications.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

History is essential in determining the cause of vomiting. Important features to elicit include the onset and duration of symptoms, the frequency and timing of episodes, the content of the vomitus (e.g., undigested food, bile-tinged,  feculent),  associated  symptoms  (e.g.,  fever,  abdominal  pain, diarrhea), exposure to foodborne pathogens, and the presence of sick contacts. A thorough past medical and surgical history (e.g., prior abdominal surgery) will also be valuable. Review the patient's medication list, as a variety of agents in therapeutic or toxic doses can trigger nausea and vomiting. The physical examination should initially focus on determining the presence or absence of a critical, life-threatening condition. Hypotension, tachycardia,  lethargy,  poor  skin  turgor,  dry  mucous  membranes,  and delayed capillary refill suggest significant dehydration. A careful abdominal examination will help clarify the presence or absence of a primary GI etiology. The extent to which the balance of the physical examination will be of value will be dictated by the history. In the event that a reliable history is not available (e.g., drug overdose, cognitive impairment), a comprehensive physical examination is warranted.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Vomiting with blood could represent gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or carcinoma. However, aggressive nonbloody vomiting followed by hematemesis is more consistent with a Mallory-Weiss tear. The presence of bile rules out gastric outlet obstruction, such as from pyloric stenosis or strictures. The presence of abdominal distension,  surgical  scars,  or  an  incarcerated hernia  suggests  a  small  bowel  obstruction.  The  presence  of  fever  would suggest  an  infectious  (e.g.,  gastroenteritis,  appendicitis,  cholecystitis)  or inflammatory cause. Vomiting with chest pain suggests myocardial infarction.  Post-tussive  vomiting  suggests  pneumonia.  Vomiting  with  back  or flank  pain  can  be  seen  with  aortic  aneurysm  or  dissection,  pancreatitis, pyelonephritis or renal colic. Headache with vomiting suggests increased intracranial  pressure,  such  as  with  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,  tumor,  or head injury. The presence of vertigo and nystagmus suggests either vestibular  or  CNS  pathology. Vomiting  in  a  pregnant  patient  is  consistent  with hyperemesis  gravidarum  in  the  first  trimester;  but  in  the  third  trimester, could represent preeclampsia if accompanied by hypertension. Associated

CHAPTER 36: Nausea and Vomiting

223

medical  conditions  are  also  useful  in  discerning  the  cause  of  vomiting: diabetes  mellitus  suggests  ketoacidosis,  peripheral  vascular  disease  suggests mesenteric ischemia, and medication use or overdose (e.g., lithium or digoxin) suggests toxicity.

All  women  of  childbearing  age  warrant  a  pregnancy  test.  In  vomiting associated with abdominal pain, liver function tests, urinalysis, and lipase or amylase determinations may be useful. Electrolyte determinations and renal function tests are usually of benefit only in patients with severe dehydration or prolonged vomiting. In addition, they may confirm the presence of adrenal insufficiency,  with  hyperkalemia  and  hyponatremia.  Obtain  specific  drug levels for acetaminophen, salicylates, and digoxin when toxicity is suspected, and urine and/or serum toxicology screens when ethanol or illicit drug use is suspected. Urinalysis revealing ketones may suggest dehydration or diabetic ketoacidosis. The presence of nitrates, leukocyte esterase, bacteria and white blood  cells  is  diagnostic  of  a  urinary  tract  infection.  The  presence  of  red blood  cells  may  suggest  nephrolithiasis.  The  electrocardiogram  and  chest radiograph can be reserved for patients with suspected cardiac ischemia or pulmonary infection. Abdominal x-rays can be used to confirm the presence of intestinal obstruction. If plain x-rays are unrevealing, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and PO contrast is not only helpful for revealing the location of a mechanical obstruction, but may also clarify alternative explanations for the patient's symptoms. CT scan of the brain will be helpful if a CNS lesion  is  suspected.  Measuring  intraocular  pressure  with  a  Tono-Pen ® (Reichert, Inc., Depew, NY) is useful if glaucoma is suspected.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The treatment of nausea and vomiting consists of correcting fluid and electrolyte  problems.  In  addition,  one  must  initiate  specific  therapy  for  any life-threatening cause identified in the initial workup.

--- Page 244 ---

224 SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

Patients  with  a  life-threatening  cause  of  vomiting  require  admission.  In addition, toxic or severely dehydrated patients, particularly infants and the elderly, or those still intolerant of oral fluids after hydration, warrant admission. Patients with an unclear diagnosis, but favorable examination findings after  hydration,  can  be  discharged  home  safely  with  antiemetics.  Work excuses  are  indicated  for  patients  in  the  food,  day  care,  and  health  care industries.

Diarrhea is defined as three or more watery stools per day. There are four basic mechanisms: increased intestinal secretion (e.g., cholera), decreased intestinal  absorption  (e.g.,  enterotoxins,  inflammation,  or  ischemia), increased osmotic load (e.g., laxatives, lactose intolerance), and abnormal intestinal motility (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome). Most cases are infectious in etiology.

# ■ DIARRHEA Clinical Features

Determine  if  the  diarrhea  is  acute  ( < 3  weeks  duration)  or  chronic ( > 3 weeks duration). Acute diarrhea is more likely to represent a serious problem, such as infection, ischemia, intoxication, or inflammation. Inquire about associated symptoms. Features such as fever, pain, presence  of  blood,  or  type  of  food  ingested  may  help  in  the  diagnosis  of infectious  gastroenteritis,  food  poisoning,  diverticulitis,  or  inflammatory bowel disease. Neurological symptoms can be seen in certain diarrheal  illnesses,  such  as  seizure  with  shigellosis  or  hyponatremia,  or paresthesias and reverse temperature sensation with ciguatoxin.

Details  about  the  host  can  also  better  define  the  diagnosis.  Malabsorption  from  pancreatic  insufficiency  or  HIV-related  bowel  disorders need  not  be  considered  in  a  healthy  host.  Dietary  practices,  including frequent restaurant meals, exposure to day care centers, consumption of street vendor food or raw seafood, overseas travel, and camping with the ingestion of lake or stream water, may isolate the vector and narrow the differential  diagnosis  for  infectious  diarrhea  (e.g.,  lakes  or  streamsGiardia ; oysters suggest Vibrio; rice suggests Bacillus cereus ; eggs suggest Salmonella ;  and  meat  suggests Campylobacter , Staphylococcus , Yersinia , Escherichia coli , or Clostridium ). Certain medications, particularly antibiotics, colchicine, lithium, and laxatives, can all contribute to diarrhea. Travel may predispose the patient to enterotoxigenic E. coli or Giardia. Social history, such as sexual preference, drug use, and occupation, may suggest diagnosis such as HIV-related illness or organophosphate poisoning.

The physical examination begins with assessment of hydration status. Abdominal examination can narrow the differential diagnosis and reveal the need for surgical intervention. Even appendicitis can present with diarrhea in up to 20% of cases. Rectal examination can rule out impaction or presence of blood, the latter suggesting inflammation, infection, or mesenteric ischemia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The most specific tests in diarrheal illness all involve examination of the stool in the laboratory. Stool culture testing should be limited to severely

225

--- Page 246 ---

226

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

dehydrated or toxic patients, those with blood or pus in their stool, immunocompromised  patients,  and  those  with  diarrhea  lasting  longer  than 3 days. Consider testing for Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter ,  Shiga toxin-producing E. coli , or amoebic infection. Make the laboratory aware of which pathogens you suspect. In patients with diarrhea > 7 days, those who have traveled abroad, or consumed untreated water, an examination for ova and parasites may be useful to rule out Giardia or Cryptosporidium .  Multiple  samples  may  be  required. Assay  for Clostridium  difficile toxin may be useful in ill patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea or recent hospitalization.

Because  most  diarrheal  illnesses  are  viral  or  self-limited,  laboratory testing in routine cases is not indicated. However, in extremely dehydrated or toxic patients, electrolyte determinations and renal function tests may be useful. (Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia, may complicate E. coli 0157:H7 infections  in  children  and  the  elderly).  If  toxicity  is  suspected,  tests  for levels for theophylline, lithium, or heavy metals will aid in the diagnosis. Radiographs are reserved for ruling out intestinal obstruction or pneumonia, particularly Legionella . In addition, CT scanning or angiography may be indicated in acute mesenteric ischemia.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The treatment of diarrhea consists of correcting fluid and electrolyte problems. (Antibiotic-associated diarrhea often responds to withdrawal of the offending  drug.)  Initiate  specific  therapy  for  any  life-threatening  cause identified in the initial workup.

Patients with an unclear diagnosis but favorable examination findings after  hydration  can  be  discharged  home  safely.  Toxic  or  severely  dehydrated patients, particularly infants and the elderly, warrant admission.

# ■ ACUtE INFECtIOUS AND tRAVELER'S DIARRHEA

Norovirus  causes  50%  to  80%  of  all  infectious  diarrheas  in  the  United States,  followed  much  less  frequently  by  non-Shiga  toxin-producing E.  coli , C.  difficile ,  invasive  bacteria  ( Campylobacter , Shigella , Salmonella ),  Shiga  toxin-producing E.  coli ,  and  protozoa. A history of foreign travel, with consumption of contaminated food or drink, is associated with an  80%  probability  of  bacterial  diarrhea,  primarily  toxin  and  nontoxinproducing strains of E. coli .

CHAPTER 37: Disorders Presenting Primarily with Diarrhea

227

# Diagnosis and Differential

Patients  with  severe  abdominal  pain,  fever,  and  bloody  stool  should undergo stool studies for specific pathogens, including culture for Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter ,  and E.  coli O157:H7;  assay  for  Shiga toxin; and microscopy or antigen assay for Entamoeba histolytica .  Exposure of a traveler or hiker to untreated water, and illness that persists for more than 7 days, should prompt an evaluation for a protozoal pathogen. Stool should be tested by enzyme immunoassay for E. histolytica antigen, Giardia intestinalis antigen, and Cryptosporidium parvum antigen.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of infectious diarrhea (including viral causes) includes antibiotics  (see  Table  37-1),  antimotility  agents,  fluid  resuscitation  (oral  or parenteral),  and  dietary  modification.  Probiotics  are  safe  and  may  be beneficial.

Antimotility agents, such as loperamide 4 mg initially, then 2 mg following  each  unformed  stool  (16  mg/day  maximum),  will  shorten  the

duration  of  symptoms  when  combined  with  an  antibiotic.  Alternative agents include bismuth subsalicylate 30 mL or 2 tablets every 30 minutes for 8 doses, or diphenoxylate and atropine 4 mg four times daily. Avoid antimotility  agents  in  the  subset  of  patients  with  bloody  or  suspected  inflammatory  diarrhea  because  of  the  potential  for  prolonged fever,  toxic  megacolon  in C.  difficile patients,  and  hemolytic  uremic syndrome in children infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli .

Most patients can be discharged home. Educate patients regarding the need  for  frequent  hand  washing  to  minimize  transmission.  Accordingly, patients employed in the food, day care, and health care industries should not return to work until diarrhea has resolved. Any toxic-appearing patient should be admitted. Consider admission for those at extremes of age as well.

Individuals should be counseled about the proper selection of food and beverages consumed when traveling abroad, as well as the use of bottled or boiled water for drinking, brushing teeth, and the preparation of food and infant formula.

# ■ CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE -ASSOCIAtED DIARRHEA AND COLItIS

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic bacillus, which secretes two toxins that interact  in  a  complex  manner  to  cause  illness  ranging  from  diarrhea  to pseudomembranous colitis. Pseudomembranous colitis is an inflammatory bowel disorder in which membrane-like yellowish plaques of exudate overlay  and  replace  necrotic  intestinal  mucosa.  Broad-spectrum  antibiotics, most  notably  clindamycin,  cephalosporins,  ampicillin,  amoxicillin,  and fluoroquinolones, alter gut flora in such a way that C. difficile can flourish within the colon, causing enteropathy. Transmission of the organism can occur from contact with humans and fomites. C. difficile is the most common  cause  of  infectious  diarrhea  in  hospitalized  patients  and  is  now reported to affect healthy adults who were not exposed to a hospital setting.

# Clinical Features

Onset is typically 7 to 10 days after initiating antibiotic treatment, but may occur up to several weeks following treatment. Clinical manifestations can vary from frequent, watery, mucoid stools to a toxic illness, characterized by profuse diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and dehydration.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis  is  confirmed  by  the  demonstration  of C.  difficile toxin  in stool. Colonoscopy is not routinely needed to confirm the diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

CHAPTER 37: Disorders Presenting Primarily with Diarrhea

229

Use of antidiarrheal agents is controversial. Probiotic treatment is not a useful adjunct. Relapses occur in 20% to 30% of patients. A first relapse is treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. A second relapse is treated with vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 14 days, followed by a four-week taper.

# ■ INFLAMMAtORY BOWEL DISEASE/CROHN'S DISEASE

Crohn's disease is a chronic, idiopathic, granulomatous inflammatory disease, characterized by segmental ulceration of the GI tract anywhere from the mouth to the anus.

# Clinical Features

The clinical course is variable and unpredictable, with multiple remissions and exacerbations. Patients commonly report a history of recurring fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea over several years before a definitive diagnosis is made. Abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, and weight loss occur in most patients. Patients may also present with complications of the disease, such  as  intestinal  obstruction,  intraabdominal  abscess,  or  a  variety  of extraintestinal manifestations. Perianal fissures or fistulas, abscesses, and rectal  prolapse  can  be  seen  in  those  with  colonic  involvement.  Fistulas occur between the ileum and sigmoid colon; the cecum, another ileal segment, or the skin; or between the colon and the vagina. Abscesses can be intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, interloop, or intramesenteric. Obstruction, hemorrhage,  and  toxic  megacolon  also  occur.  Toxic  megacolon  can  be associated with massive GI bleeding.

Up to 40% of patients develop extraintestinal manifestations, including arthritis, uveitis, nephrolithiasis, and skin disease (e.g., erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum). Hepatobiliary disease, including gallstones, pericholangitis, and chronic active hepatitis, is commonly seen, as is pancreatitis. Some patients develop thromboembolic disease as a result of a hypercoaguable state. Malabsorption, malnutrition, and chronic anemia develop in longstanding disease. The recurrence rate for those with Crohn's disease is 25% to 50% when treated medically; higher for patients treated surgically.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease is usually established months or years after the onset of symptoms. A careful and detailed history for

--- Page 250 ---

230

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

previous bowel symptoms that preceded the acute presentation may provide clues to the correct diagnosis. Abdominal CT scanning is the most useful  diagnostic  test,  potentially  revealing  bowel  wall  thickening,  segmental narrowing, destruction of the normal mucosal pattern, mesenteric edema, abscess formation, and fistulas, as well as extraintestinal complications (e.g., gallstones, renal stones, sacroiliitis). Colonoscopy can detect early mucosal lesions, define the extent of colonic involvement, and identify colon cancer.

The differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease includes lymphoma, ileocecal  amebiasis,  sarcoidosis,  chronic  mycotic  infections,  tuberculosis, Kaposi sarcoma, Campylobacter enteritis, and Yersinia ileocolitis. Most of these conditions are uncommon, and the latter two can be differentiated by stool  cultures.  When  confined  to  the  colon,  ischemic  colitis,  infectious colitis,  pseudomembranous  enterocolitis,  irritable  bowel  syndrome,  and ulcerative colitis should be considered.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Initial evaluation should determine the severity of the attack and identify significant  complications.  Laboratory  evaluation  includes  complete blood  count,  chemistries,  and  type  and  cross  match  when  indicated. Plain abdominal x-rays may identify obstruction, perforation, and toxic megacolon,  which  may  appear  as  a  long,  continuous  segment  of  airfilled  colon  greater  than  6  cm  in  diameter.  CT  of  the  abdomen  is  the most useful test to confirm the diagnosis, and identify both intraintestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Initial ED management includes intravenous fluid replacement, parenteral analgesia, bowel rest, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and nasogastric suction if obstruction, ileus, or toxic megacolon is present. Additional treatment may include the following:

--- Page 251 ---

CHAPTER 37: Disorders Presenting Primarily with Diarrhea

231

Hospital admission is recommended for those who demonstrate signs of fulminant  colitis,  peritonitis,  obstruction,  significant  hemorrhage,  severe dehydration, or electrolyte imbalance, or those with less severe disease who fail  outpatient  management. Surgical intervention is indicated in patients with  intestinal  obstruction  or  hemorrhage,  perforation,  abscess  or  fistula formation, toxic megacolon, or perianal disease, and in some patients who fail medical therapy. Alterations in therapy should be discussed with a gastroenterologist, and close follow-up must be ensured for patients discharged from the ED.

# ■ ULCERAtIVE COLItIS

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory and ulcerative disease of the colon and rectum, characterized clinically by intermittent episodes  of  crampy  abdominal  pain,  bloody  diarrhea,  and  tenesmus,  with complete remission between bouts.

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  mild  disease  (60%),  typically  limited  to  the  rectum,  have fewer than four bowel movements per day, no systemic symptoms, and few extraintestinal manifestations. Patients with moderate disease (25%) have colitis extending to the splenic flexure. Severe disease (pancolitis) is associated with frequent daily bowel movements, weight loss, fever, tachycardia, anemia, and more frequent extraintestinal manifestations, including peripheral  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  episcleritis,  uveitis,  pyoderma  gangrenosum,  erythema  nodosum,  hepatobiliary  disease,  thromboembolic disease, renal stones, and malnutrition.

Complications  include  GI  hemorrhage  (most  common),  perirectal abscess and fistula formation, obstruction secondary to stricture formation, and acute perforation. There is a 10- to 30-fold increase in the risk of  developing  colon  carcinoma.  The  most  feared  complication  is  toxic megacolon,  which  presents  with  fever,  tachycardia,  dehydration,  and  a tender, distended abdomen. X-ray reveals a long, continuous segment of air-filled  colon > 6  cm  in  diameter.  Perforation  and  peritonitis  are  lifethreatening complications.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  of  ulcerative  colitis  may  be  considered  with  a  history  of abdominal cramps, diarrhea,  and  mucoid  stools.  Laboratory  findings  are nonspecific  and  may  include  leukocytosis,  anemia,  thrombocytosis, decreased serum albumin levels, abnormal liver function test results, and negative stool studies for ova, parasites, and enteric pathogens. Abdominal CT scanning is important for the diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain or for suspected colitis. Colonoscopy can confirm the diagnosis and define the extent of colonic involvement. The differential diagnosis includes infectious,  ischemic,  radiation,  antineoplastic  agent  induced,  pseudomembranous,  and  Crohn's  colitis.  When  the  disease  is  limited  to  the  rectum, consider  sexually  acquired  diseases,  such  as  rectal  syphilis,  gonococcal proctitis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and inflammation caused by herpes simplex virus, Entamoeba histolytica , Shigella , and Campylobacter .

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Patients  with  severe  disease  should  be  admitted  for  intravenous  fluid replacement,  parenteral  analgesia,  bowel  rest,  correction  of  electrolyte abnormalities, and nasogastric suction if obstruction, ileus, or toxic megacolon  is  present.  Consultation  with  both  gastroenterology  and  surgery should  be  arranged  for  patients  with  significant  GI  hemorrhage,  toxic megacolon, and bowel perforation. In addition, the following interventions should be considered:

The majority of patients with mild to moderate disease can be treated as outpatients. Therapy listed below should be discussed with a gastroenterologist, and close follow-up must be ensured.

Supportive measures include a nutritious diet, physical and psychological  rest,  replenishment  of  iron  stores,  dietary  elimination  of  lactose,  and addition  of  bulking  agents,  such  as psyllium .  Antidiarrheal  agents  can precipitate toxic megacolon and should be avoided.

# Acute and Chronic Constipation Thomas E. Carter

Constipation is the most common digestive complaint in the United States. Gut motility is affected by diet, activity level, and multiple, often overlapping, causes.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Constipation is characterized by the presence of two or more of the following  complaints  straining,  hard  stools,  incomplete  evacuation,  and  fewer than three bowel movements per week. Constipation is chronic in patients with symptoms for 12 weeks consecutive or nonconsecutive of the preceding  12  months.  Differentiating  acute  from  chronic  and  functional  from organic constipation can guide treatment. Functional constipation features include changes in medications or dietary supplements, a decrease in fluid or  fiber  intake,  or  a  change  in  activity  level  including  illness  or  injury. Organic constipation is suggested by acute onset, weight loss, rectal bleeding/melena, nausea/vomiting, inability to pass flatus, fever, rectal pain and change  in  stool  caliber.  Organic  constipation  has  priority  diagnosis  of obstruction and carcinoma. A family history of colon, ovarian or uterine cancer plus an assessment of associated illnesses may elucidate other primary or comorbid diagnoses: cold intolerance (hypothyroidism), diverticulitis  (inflammatory  stricture),  or  nephrolithiasis  (hyperparathyroidism). Diarrhea  may  occur  with  constipation/obstruction  symptoms,  as  liquid stool can pass around an impaction or obstructive source.

Physical examination should focus on detection of hernias, abdominal masses,  and  ascites  (carcinoma).  Bowel  sounds  will  be  decreased  in  the setting of slow gut transit, but increased in the setting of obstruction. Visual and  digital  rectal  examination  will  detect  tone,  masses,  foreign  bodies, hemorrhoids, abscesses, fecal impaction, anal fissures, or fecal blood. The latter, accompanied by weight loss or decreasing stool caliber, may confirm the  presence  of  carcinoma.  Fecal  impaction  may  produce  ulcers  causing rectal bleeding.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  differential  diagnosis  for  constipation  is  extensive,  as  noted  in Table 38-1. Prioritize testing to evaluate organic constipation and complications  of  functional  constipation  based  on  suspicion;  this  may  include  a complete blood count (to rule out anemia), thyroid stimulating hormone (to rule out hypothyroidism), and electrolyte determinations (to rule out hypokalemia or hypercalcemia). Flat and erect abdominal films may be useful in confirming obstruction and pseudo-obstruction or assessing stool burden. computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast may  be  necessary  to  identify  organic  causes  of  constipation  including obstruction, carcinoma, or impaction.

Chronic  constipation  is  usually  a  functional  disorder  that  can  be worked  up  on  an  outpatient  basis.  However,  complications  of  chronic

constipation, such as fecal impaction and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, may become life-threatening and will require manual, colonoscopic, or surgical intervention.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Treatment of functional constipation is directed at severity,  symptomatic relief,  as  well  as  addressing  lifestyle  issues.  Occasionally,  specific  treatment is required for complications of constipation or for underlying disorders that can prevent organic constipation.

# Gastrointestinal Bleeding

Mitchell C. Sokolosky

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common problem in emergency medicine  and  should  be  considered  life-threatening  until  proven  otherwise. Acute upper GI bleeding is more common than lower GI bleeding. Upper GI bleeding is defined as that originating proximal to the ligament of Treitz. Upper GI bleeds can result from peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis and esophagitis, esophageal and gastric varices, and Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Lower GI bleeds most commonly result from diverticular disease, followed by  colitis,  adenomatous  polyps,  and  malignancies.  What  may  initially appear to be lower GI bleeding may be upper GI bleeding in disguise.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Most patients complain of hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, hematochezia, or melena. Others will present with hypotension, tachycardia, angina, syncope, weakness, and confusion. Hematemesis or coffee-ground emesis suggests  an  upper  GI  source.  Melena  suggests  a  source  proximal  to  the right colon. Hematochezia (bright red or maroon-colored) indicates a more distal colorectal lesion; however, approximately 10% of hematochezia may be associated with upper GI bleeding. Weight loss and changes in bowel habits  are  classic  symptoms  of  malignancy.  V omiting  and  retching,  followed by hematemesis, is suggestive of a Mallory-Weiss tear. A history of medication  or  alcohol  use  should  be  sought.  This  history  may  suggest peptic  ulcer  disease,  gastritis,  or  esophageal  varices.  Spider  angiomata, palmar  erythema,  jaundice,  and  gynecomastia  suggest  underlying  liver disease.  Ingestion  of  iron  or  bismuth  can  simulate  melena,  and  certain foods,  such  as  beets,  can  simulate  hematochezia.  However,  stool  heme (guaiac) testing will be negative.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  diagnosis  may  be  obvious  with  the  finding  of  hematemesis,  coffee ground emesis, hematochezia, or melena. A careful ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination can exclude swallowed blood as a source. Nasogastric (NG) tube placement and aspiration may detect occult upper GI bleeding. A negative NG aspirate does not conclusively exclude an upper GI source. Guaiac  testing  of  NG  aspirate  can  yield  both  false-negative  and  falsepositive  results.  Most  reliable  is  gross  inspection  of  the  aspirate  for  a bloody,  maroon,  or  coffee-ground  appearance. A  rectal  examination  can detect the presence of blood, its appearance (bright red, maroon, or melanotic), and the presence of masses. All patients with significant GI bleeding require  type  and  crossmatch  for  blood.  Other  important  tests  include  a complete  blood  count,  electrolytes,  blood  urea  nitrogen,  creatinine,  glucose,  coagulation  studies,  and  liver  function  tests.  The  initial  hematocrit level may not reflect the actual amount of blood loss. Upper GI bleeding may elevate the blood urea nitrogen level. Routine plain radiographs are of limited  value.  The  initial  diagnostic  procedure  of  choice  for  lower  GI

237

--- Page 258 ---

238

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

bleeds-angiography,  scintigraphy,  or  endoscopy-depends  on  resource ability and consultant preference. In one study, a cause for lower GI bleeding was found in < 50% of cases.

--- Page 259 ---

Complaints of dysphagia, odynophagia, or ingested foreign body usually imply esophageal disease. Chest pain, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malignancy,  and  mediastinitis  may  also  be  esophageal  in  nature.  Many diseases of the esophagus can be evaluated over time in an outpatient setting, but several, such as esophageal foreign body and esophageal perforation, require emergent evaluation.

# ■ DYSPHAGIA

Dysphagia is difficulty with swallowing. Most patients with dysphagia have an identifiable organic cause. The two broad pathophysiologic groups of dysphagia are transfer dysphagia (oropharyngeal) and transport dysphagia (esophageal).

# Clinical Features

A  careful  history  is  the  key  to  the  diagnosis  of  dysphagia.  Determine whether solids, liquids, or both cause the symptoms and the time course and progression of symptoms. Dysphagia for solids that progresses to liquids suggests a mechanical or obstructive process. Dysphagia for both solids and liquids  points  to  a  motility  disorder.  A  poorly  chewed  meat  bolus  may obstruct the esophagus and be the presenting sign for a variety of underlying  esophageal  pathologies.  Esophageal  filling  proximal  to  the  impacted bolus can cause inability to swallow secretions and can present an airway or aspiration risk. Physical examination of patients with dysphagia should focus on the head and neck and the neurologic examination, although the examination is often normal.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of the underlying pathology of dysphagia is most often made outside  the  emergency  department  (ED).  ED  evaluation  may  include anteroposterior and lateral neck and chest x-rays. Direct laryngoscopy may identify lesions. Structural or obstructive causes of dysphagia include neoplasms (squamous cell is most common), esophageal strictures and webs, Schatzki  ring,  and  diverticula.  Motor  lesions  causing  dysphagia  include neuromuscular disorders (cerebrovascular accident is most common), achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, and esophageal dysmotility.

# ■ CHeSt PAIN OF eSOPHAGeAL OrIGIN

Differentiating esophageal pain from ischemic chest pain is difficult at best and  may  be  impossible  in  the  ED.  Patients  with  esophageal  pain  report symptoms that are also found in patients with coronary artery disease, and there is no historical feature that is sensitive or specific enough to differentiate  the  two.  The  best  ED  default  assumption  is  that  pain  is  cardiac  in nature and not esophageal until proven otherwise.

# Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes a wide array of symptoms and long-term effects.

# Clinical Features

Heartburn  is  the  classic  symptom  of  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease (GERD), although chest discomfort may be the only symptom. The association of pain with meals, postural changes, and relief of symptoms with antacids  point  to  a  diagnosis  of  GERD.  Less  obvious  presentations  of GERD include pulmonary symptoms, especially asthma exacerbations, and multiple ear, nose, and throat symptoms. GERD has also been implicated in the etiology of dental erosion, vocal cord ulcers and granulomas, laryngitis  with  hoarseness,  chronic  sinusitis,  and  chronic  cough.  Over  time, GERD can cause complications such as strictures, inflammatory esophagitis, and Barrett esophagus (a premalignant condition).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is suggested by history and favorable response to antacid treatment. However, some patients with symptoms due to cardiac ischemia also report improvement with the same therapy. Unfortunately, like cardiac pain, GERD pain may be squeezing or pressure-like and includes a history of onset  with  exertion  or  rest.  Both  types  of  pain  may  be  accompanied  by diaphoresis, pallor, radiation, and nausea and vomiting. An ECG and chest radiograph  can  be  obtained  in  patients  with  ambiguous  presentations. Given  the  serious  outcome  of  unrecognized  ischemic  disease  compared with the relatively benign nature of esophageal pain, a cautious approach is warranted.

CHAPTER 40: Esophageal Emergencies

241

# Esophagitis

Esophagitis  can  cause  prolonged  periods  of  chest  pain  and  odynophagia. Esophagitis may be inflammatory (e.g., GERD, NSAIDs, potassium chloride, doxycycline, tetracycline, and clindamycin) or infectious if immunosuppressed (e.g., Candida most common, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus (CMV),  and aphthous ulceration). Withdrawal of offending agent is generally  curative  with  medication-induced  esophagitis.  Patients  with  refluxinduced esophagitis require acid-suppressive medications. Infectious causes are established by endoscopy often with biopsy and specimen cultures.

# Esophageal Perforation

Iatrogentic  perforation  is  most  common.  Other  causes  include  transient increase  in  intraesophageal  pressure  ( Boerhaave syndrome ),  trauma,  foreign  body,  infection,  tumor,  and  aortic  pathology.  Perforation  of  the esophagus is associated with a high mortality rate.

# Clinical Features

Pain is classically described as acute, severe, unrelenting, and diffuse and is reported in the chest, neck, and abdomen. Pain can radiate to the back and shoulders, or back pain may be the predominant symptom. Swallowing often exacerbates pain. Physical examination varies with the severity of the rupture and the elapsed time between the rupture and presentation. Abdominal rigidity with hypotension and fever often occur early. Tachycardia and tachypnea are common. Mediastinal emphysema takes time to develop. It is less commonly detected by examination or radiography in lower esophageal perforation and its absence does not rule out perforation. A Hammon crunch can sometimes be auscultated. Pleural effusions develop in 50% of patients with intrathoracic perforations and are uncommon in cervical perforations.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Chest radiography can suggest the diagnosis. Given the limitations of CT, an esophagram or emergency endoscopy is most often used to confirm the diagnosis. Selection of the procedure depends upon the clinical setting and the resources available. Mistaking perforation for acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or an acute abdomen can lead to delays in therapy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Swallowed Foreign Bodies

Children (18 to 48 months old) and those with mental illness account for most cases. Coins, toys, and crayons typically lodge in the anatomically

--- Page 262 ---

242 SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

narrow  proximal  esophagus. Adult  candidates  are  those  with  esophageal disease, prisoners, and psychiatric patients. In adults, most impactions are distal. Complications include airway obstruction, stricture, and perforation. Once an object transverses the pylorus, it usually continues through the GI tract. Objects that become lodged distal to the pylorus are usually irregular, have sharp edges, and are wide ( > 2.5 cm) or long ( > 6 cm)

# Clinical Features

Objects lodged in the esophagus can produce retrosternal pain, dysphagia, coughing, choking, vomiting, and aspiration, and the patient may be unable to  swallow secretions. Adults with an esophageal foreign body generally provide unequivocal history. In the pediatric patient it may be necessary to rely on clues such as refusal or inability to eat, vomiting, gagging, choking, stridor, neck or throat pain, dysphagia, and drooling.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Physical examination starts with an assessment of the airway. The nasopharynx, oropharynx, neck, and chest should also be examined. Occasionally, a foreign body can be directly visualized in the oropharynx. Plain films are  used  to  screen  for  radiopaque  objects.  CT  scanning  has  replaced  the barium swallow test to evaluate for nonradiopaque objects.

Meat is the most common cause of food impaction.

Peptic  ulcer  disease  (PUD)  is  a  chronic  illness  manifested  by  recurrent ulcerations in the stomach and duodenum. Acid and pepsin are crucial for ulcer development, but the great majority of ulcers are directly related to infection with Helicobacter pylori or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use. Gastritis is an acute or chronic gastric mucosal inflammation and has various causes. Dyspepsia is upper abdominal discomfort with or without other symptoms that can have various causes or be functional.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Peptic ulcer disease typically presents with burning epigastric pain, though it may be described as sharp, dull, and an ache, or an 'empty' or 'hungry' feeling. It may be relieved by the ingestion of food, milk, or antacids, presumably due to an acid buffering or a dilutional effect. The pain recurs as the gastric contents empty and the recurrent pain classically awakens the patient at night. Atypical presentations are common in the elderly and may include  no  pain,  pain  that  is  not  relieved  by  food,  nausea,  vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and/or bleeding.

A change in the character of the pain may herald the onset of a complication. Abrupt onset of severe pain is typical of perforation with spillage of gastric  or  duodenal  contents  into  the  peritoneal  cavity.  Back  pain  may represent pancreatitis from a posterior perforation. Nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and weight loss may occur with gastric outlet obstruction or cancer. Vomiting blood or passing melanotic stools with or without hemodynamic instability represents a bleeding complication.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Peptic ulcer disease cannot be definitively diagnosed on clinical grounds, but it can be strongly suspected in the presence of a 'classic' history (as above) accompanied by 'benign' physical examination findings and normal  vital  signs  with  or  without  mild  epigastric  tenderness.  Examination findings that may be indicative of PUD complications include a rigid abdomen consistent  with  peritonitis  in  perforation,  abdominal  distension  and succussion splash consistent with gastric outlet obstruction, occult or gross rectal blood, or blood in nasogastric aspirate consistent with bleeding.

The differential diagnosis of epigastric pain is extensive. Pain, radiating into the chest, and belching may point to gastroesophageal reflux disease; more severe pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) radiating around the right side of the abdomen with tenderness suggests cholelithiasis or biliary colic;  pain  radiating  into  the  back  is  common  with  pancreatitis  and/or  a concomitant mass may represent a pseudocyst or if the mass is pulsatile may represent an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Chronic pain, anorexia, and weight  loss  with  or  without  a  mass  may  represent  cancer.  Myocardial

244

CHAPTER 41: Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastritis

245

ischemia may present as epigastric pain and should be strongly considered in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the population of diabetics and the elderly.

Some ancillary tests may be helpful to exclude PUD complications and to narrow the differential. A normal CBC rules out chronic (but not acute) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatitis.  Elevated lipase may indicate pancreatitis. An upright xray may show free air in the setting a perforation and an abdominal US examination may show  cholecystitis,  cholelithiasis,  or  an  abdominal  arotic  aneurysm.  An ECG and troponin are indicated if myocardial ischemia is suspected.

The gold standard for diagnosis of PUD is visualization of an ulcer by upper GI endoscopy. Endoscopy is indicated in most patients with upper GI bleeding and in any patient with certain 'alarm' features consistent with cancer: age > 55 year, unexplained weight loss, early satiety or anorexia, persistent  vomiting,  dysphagia,  anemia,  abdominal  mass,  or  jaundice. Because of the strong association of H. pylori infection with PUD, testing for  the  presence  of H.  pylori with  PUD  is  usually  indicated,  but  this  is generally more appropriate at the time of follow-up with gastroenterologist.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

After PUD is diagnosed, the goal of treatment is to heal the ulcer while relieving pain and preventing complications and avoiding recurrence. If the patient is infected with H. pylori then it must be eradicated in order to prevent ulcer recurrence. NSAIDs should be stopped whenever possible.

# Pancreatitis and Cholecystitis

Rita K. Cydulka

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammation of the pancreas. Disease severity  ranges  from  mild  local  inflammation  to  multisystem  organ  failure secondary to a systemic inflammatory response. Cholelithiasis and alcohol abuse are the most common causes, but there are many potential etiologies. Patients  without  risk  factors  often  develop  pancreatitis  secondary  to medications or severe hyperlipidemia. Commonly used medications associated  with  pancreatitis  include  acetaminophen,  carbamazepine,  enalapril, estrogens, erythromycin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, opiates, steroids, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

# ■ PANCREATITIS

# Clinical Features

The  most  common  symptom  is  a  midepigastric,  constant,  boring  pain radiating to the back that is worse when the patient is supine and is often associated  with  nausea,  vomiting,  and  abdominal  distention.  Low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension may be present. Epigastric tenderness is common, whereas peritonitis is a late finding.

Physical  findings  are  dependent  on  the  severity  of  disease.  Physical examination  findings  include  epigastric  tenderness,  but  tenderness  may localize  more  to  the  right  or  left  upper  quadrant  of  the  abdomen.  Bowel sounds may be diminished and abdominal distention may be present secondary to ileus. Refractory hypotensive shock, renal failure, fever, altered mental status, and respiratory failure may accompany the most severe disease.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis should be suspected by the history and physical examination. The presence of two of the three following features makes the diagnosis more  likely:  (1)  history  and  examination  findings  consistent  with  AP, (2) lipase or amylase levels at least two to three times the upper limit of normal, or (3) imaging findings consistent with pancreatic inflammation. Lipase is the preferred diagnostic test as it is more accurate. There are many sources  of  extrapancreatic  amylase,  making  it  relatively  nonspecific. Normal serum amylase does not exclude the diagnosis of AP. There is no benefit to ordering both tests.

A CBC will identify leukocytosis or anemia. Liver studies can demonstrate  associated  biliary  involvement.  An  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase level suggests biliary disease and gallstone pancreatitis. Persistent hypocalcemia  ( < 7  mg/100  mL),  hypoxia,  increasing  serum  urea  nitrogen,  and metabolic acidosis are associated with a potentially complicated course.

Imaging can help confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis, evaluate biliary involvement, and exclude causes of abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is preferred  over  ultrasound  as  the  latter  is  often limited by bowel gas overlying the pancreas. In the face of a typical clinical picture and laboratory results, emergency imaging may not be needed.

247

--- Page 268 ---

248 SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

The  differential  diagnosis  includes  referred  chest  pain  secondary  to ischemic heart disease, pulmonary pathology such as pneumonia or empyema,  hepatitis,  cholecystitis  or  biliary  colic,  ascending  cholangitis,  renal colic, small bowel obstruction, peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, and acute aortic pathology such as aneurysm or dissection.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Care for the patient with pancreatitis includes fluid resuscitation; management of nausea, vomiting, and pain; and diligent monitoring of vital signs and pulse oximetry.

# ■ ChOLECYSTITIS

Biliary tract emergencies most often result from obstruction of the gallbladder  or  biliary  duct  by  gallstones.  The  four  most  common  biliary  tract emergencies caused by gallstones are biliary colic, cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis,  and  ascending  cholangitis.  Biliary  disease  affects  all  age groups, especially diabetics and the elderly. Gallstones, although common in the general population, remain asymptomatic in most patients. Common

--- Page 269 ---

CHAPTER 42: Pancreatitis and Cholecystitis

249

risk factors for gallstones and cholecystitis include advanced age, female sex  and  parity,  obesity,  rapid  weight  loss  or  prolonged  fasting,  familial tendency, use of some medications, Asian ancestry, chronic liver disease, and hemolytic disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease).

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  biliary  disease  present  with  a  wide  range  of  symptoms. Biliary colic may present with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, may range from mild to severe, and, although classically described as intermittent or colicky, is often constant. Nausea and vomiting are usually present. Pain may be referred to the right shoulder or left upper back. It may begin after  eating  but  often  bears  no  association  to  meals.  Acute  episodes  of biliary colic typically last for 1 to 5 hours, followed by a gradual or sudden resolution of symptoms. Recurrent episodes are usually infrequent, generally at intervals longer than 1 week. Biliary colic seems to follow a circadian pattern, with highest incidence of symptoms between 9 pm and 4 am.

Physical examination commonly demonstrates right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness without findings of peritonitis.

Acute cholecystitis presents with pain similar to that of biliary colic that persists for longer than the typical 5 hours. Fever, chills, nausea, emesis, and anorexia are common. Past history of similar attacks or known gallstones may be reported. As the gallbladder becomes progressively inflamed, the initial poorly localized upper abdominal pain often becomes sharp and localized to the right upper quadrant. The patient may have moderate to severe  distress  and  may  appear  toxic.  Choledocholithiasis  often  presents with midline pain that radiates to the middle of the back.

Examination findings include tenderness in the right upper quadrant or epigastrum, and Murphy's sign (increased pain or inspiratory arrest during deep subcostal palpation of the right upper quadrant during deep inspiration). Murphy's sign is the most sensitive physical examination finding for the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Generalized abdominal rigidity suggests perforation and diffuse peritonitis. V olume depletion is common, but jaundice is unusual. Acalculous cholecystitis occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with cholecystitis, has a more rapid, aggressive clinical course, and occurs more frequently in patients with diabetes, the elderly, trauma or burn victims, after prolonged labor or major surgery, or with systemic vasculitides.

Ascending cholangitis, a life-threatening condition with high mortality, results from complete biliary obstruction (often a common bile duct stone; less commonly a tumor) with bacterial superinfection. Patients often present  in  extremis  with  jaundice,  fever,  confusion,  and  shock.  Examination findings can be subtle. Patients commonly have focal right upper quadrant pain and nausea. Jaundice may or may not be present. The Charcot triad of fever,  jaundice,  and  right  upper  quadrant  pain  is  suggestive  but  all  three components are usually not present at once.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Suspicion of gallbladder or biliary tract disease must be maintained in any patient who presents with upper abdominal pain. The differential diagnosis is similar to that of AP (see Diagnosis and Differential section under the section Pancreatitis, earlier).

--- Page 270 ---

250

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

Patients with uncomplicated biliary colic usually have normal laboratory findings. The diagnosis is usually made based on the patient presentation, response to therapy, and examining the test results in aggregate.

Laboratory studies that may aid in diagnosis include a white blood cell count; leukocytosis with left shift suggests acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis, but a normal white blood cell count does not exclude them. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels may be normal or mildly elevated  in  patients  suffering  from  biliary  colic  or  cholecystitis.  Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels are usually elevated in cases of choledocholithiasis  and  ascending  cholangitis.  Serum  lipase  or  amylase levels should be checked to help exclude associated pancreatitis.

Ultrasound  of  the  hepatobiliary  tract  is  the  initial  diagnostic  study of  choice  for  patients  with  suspected  biliary  colic  or  cholecystitis (see Fig. 42-1). It can detect stones as small as 2 mm and signs of cholecystitis which include a thickened gallbladder wall ( > 3 to 5 mm), gallbladder  distention  ( > 4  cm  in  short-axis  view),  and  pericholecystic  fluid.  A positive sonographic Murphy's sign is very sensitive for diagnosis of cholecystitis when it is elicited during the scan. Ultrasound has a strong positive  predictive value (92%) when both a sonographic Murphy's sign and gallstones are present. Choledocholithiasis is suggested when the common bile duct diameter is greater than 5 to 7 mm.

Computed tomography of the abdomen is most useful when additional intraabdominal  processes  are  suspected.  Radionuclide  cholescintigraphy (technetium-iminodiacetic acid [HIDA]) or diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid ([DISIDA] scans) offers a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 90% for cholecystitis. A reasonable emergency department (ED) approach to suspected  cholecystitis  would  be  to  obtain  an  ultrasound  scan  and  then  a radionuclide scan if ultrasound fails to establish the diagnosis.

# Acute Appendicitis

Charles E. Stewart

Appendicitis  is  one  of  the  most  common  surgical  emergencies.  Despite advances in laboratory testing and imaging, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis remains a challenge. Complications from misdiagnosis of appendicitis include  intraabdominal  abscess,  wound  infection,  adhesion  formation, bowel obstruction, and infertility.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The  early  signs  and  symptoms  of  appendicitis  are  quite  nonspecific  and progress with time. The most reliable symptom in appendicitis is abdominal pain. Pain commonly begins in the periumbilical or epigastric region. As peritoneal irritation occurs, the pain often localizes to the right lower quadrant. The final location of the pain depends on the location of the appendix. Other symptoms associated with appendicitis include anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, but these symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific. As the pain increases, irritation of the bladder and/or colon may cause dysuria, tenesmus, or other symptoms. Many patients have the 'bump' sign, where the patient notes an increase in the abdominal pain associated with bumps in the ride  to  the  hospital.  Other  physicians  will  have  the  patient  jump  up  and down in the examining room to evoke the pain. (Such maneuvers illustrate peritoneal irritation, but are nonspecific for appendicitis.) If the pain suddenly decreases, the examiner should consider appendiceal perforation.

The classic point of maximal tenderness is in the right lower quadrant just below the middle of a line connecting the umbilicus and the right anterior superior iliac spine (McBurney's point). Patients may also have pain referred to the right lower quadrant when palpating the left lower quadrant (Rovsing's sign), pain elicited by extending the right leg to the hip while lying in the left lateral decubitus position (psoas sign), or pain elicited by passively  flexing  the  right  hip  and  knee  and  internally  rotating  the  hip (obturator sign). Patients with a pelvic appendix may be quite tender on rectal examination, and patients with a retrocecal appendix may have more prominent flank pain than abdominal pain. No individual physical finding is sensitive or specific enough to rule in or rule out the diagnosis, and all physical findings and maneuvers depend on irritation of the peritoneum.

Fever is a relatively late finding in appendicitis and rarely exceeds 39°C (102.2°F),  unless  rupture  or  other  complications  occur.  Meta-analysis  of 42 studies found that fever was the single most useful sign, followed by rebound tenderness and migration of the pain to the right lower quadrant.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Even  with  that  caveat,  the  diagnosis  of  acute  appendicitis  is  primarily clinical.  Symptoms  with  high  sensitivity  for  appendicitis  include  fever, right lower quadrant pain, pain that occurs before vomiting, and absence of prior similar pain. Migration of the pain is thought to be a strong predictor

252

--- Page 273 ---

CHAPTER 43: Acute Appendicitis

253

for  appendicitis.  Physical  signs  with  high  specificity  include  right  lower abdominal rigidity and positive psoas sign. In both children and adults, no single historical or physical examination finding is sufficient to make an unequivocal diagnosis of appendicitis. Consider appendicitis in any patient with atraumatic right-sided abdominal, periumbilical, or flank pain who has not previously undergone appendectomy.

Additional  studies,  such  as  complete  blood  count,  C-reactive  protein, urinalysis, and imaging studies, may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear, but lack the sensitivity to rule in or rule out the diagnosis. The combination of a normal WBC and C-reactive protein may have some utility as a negative screening test, as the likelihood of both being negative despite a pathologic diagnosis of appendicitis in a patient with a low pre-test probability is quite low. Unfortunately, these tests are often elevated in multiple conditions, so the reverse has almost no value. A pregnancy test must be performed in all females of reproductive age. A normal WBC does not rule out appendicitis. Urinalysis is useful to help rule out other diagnoses, but pyuria and hematuria can occur when an inflamed appendix irritates the ureter.

The  differential  diagnosis  of  right  lower  quadrant  pain  is  wide  and includes other gastrointestinal processes (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, hernia,  abscess,  volvulus,  diverticulitis),  gynecologic  or  urological  processes (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, renal colic, genitourinary (GU) infection  or  abscess),  or  musculoskeletal  processes  (e.g.,  muscular hematoma or abscess).

Scoring systems such as the Alvarado and Samuel scoring systems have been developed to aid in diagnosis. These scoring systems have uniformly had less sensitivity for diagnosis of appendicitis than the clinical judgment of an experienced examiner and should not replace this experienced-based decision.

The goal of imaging is to establish the diagnosis of appendicitis, avoid a negative appendectomy, and identify other potential causes of abdominal pain.  Increased  concerns  about  accumulated  radiation  exposure  for  children,  potentially  childbearing  females,  and  pregnant  patients  have  led  to growing interest in alternatives to the CT scan. Unfortunately, imaging can also escalate the cost of the medical care.

Plain radiographs of the abdomen are not helpful.

Computed tomography (CT) is probably the imaging study of choice for most patients with an overall sensitivity of 96% and PPV of 96%. CT findings  suggesting  acute  appendicitis  include  pericecal  inflammation, abscess, and periappendiceal phlegmon or fluid collections (Fig. 43-1). CT has been shown to change management in women, decreasing unnecessary tests. CT may be conducted with or without contrast administered orally, intravenously, or rectally, depending on institutional experience and preference. Unenhanced CT scanning has 92% sensitivity and 96% specificity. Noncontrast CT should be considered an acceptable imaging modality in the workup of acute appendicitis. Clearly, no contrast should be used for patients with allergy to contrast or for patients with renal disease. CT findings of appendicitis may be obscured in the thin patient, as intraperitoneal fat serves as an intrinsic contrast medium in unenhanced CT.

Ultrasonography has a high sensitivity but is limited both by operator skill  and  in  evaluating  a  ruptured  appendix  or  an  abnormally  located (e.g., retrocecal) appendix. Reports of the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)

--- Page 274 ---

254

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy are conflicting, with some reporting US as useful and others reporting it as ineffective for diagnosis.

Graded compression ultrasonography is the initial modality of choice in both children and the pregnant patient to decrease radiation exposure. Overall sensitivity of US is 86% with positive predictive value (PPV) of 95%. Given the highly operator-dependent nature of ultrasonography, hospitals that frequently perform US for diagnosis of appendicitis may have greater reproducibility of high-quality studies. The diagnostic accuracy of abdominal US in children is better at ruling in acute appendicitis than excluding it.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of appendicitis is  accepted  in  many  hospitals  as  a  reliable  technology  that  avoids  completely  the  ionizing  radiation  risks.  IV  gadolinium  contrast  with  MRI should be avoided in the pregnant patient as it crosses the placenta, given the teratogenic effects seen in animal studies. Gadolinium is not given to patients with renal disease as it may exacerbate the renal insufficiency.

The elderly patient is more likely to have preexisting comorbidities and may be taking medications that alter presentation, management, and outcomes.  Elderly  patients  may  have  decreased  perceptions  of  symptoms. Patients  with  communication  difficulties  and  those  with  poor  access  to medical care may also have vague complaints, including diffuse pain, fever,

--- Page 275 ---

CHAPTER 43: Acute Appendicitis

255

or alteration in mental status. Such individuals commonly present later in the course of the disease and are more likely to have worse outcomes. In these patients, an atypical presentation is quite common and alternative or comorbid diagnoses are often found on imaging.

The pediatric patient who cannot verbalize symptoms also presents a significant challenge. Patients younger than 6 years have a high misdiagnosis  rate  due  to  poor  communication  skills  and  the  association  of  many nonspecific  symptoms.  Careful  history  from  the  parent  or  guardian  and equally  careful  physical  examination  are  essential  to  accurate  diagnosis. Coordinate imaging studies in these patients with your surgical consultant to ensure most accurate diagnosis with least radiation exposure.

Pregnant patients are at risk for misdiagnosis. Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in pregnancy, and delay in diagnosis is the greatest cause of increased morbidity in the pregnant woman with an acute abdomen. Ovarian torsion and ectopic or heterotopic pregnancy are additional considerations in the fertile female. If an abdominal US is nondiagnostic or not available, consider pelvic US, CT, or MRI.

Diverticulitis is a common GI disorder that occurs when small herniations through the wall of the colon, or diverticula, become inflamed or infected.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Classically,  diverticulitis  presents  with  left  lower  abdominal  pain,  fever, and leukocytosis. The most common symptom is a steady, deep discomfort in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Pain may be constant or intermittent, with associated symptoms of change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea), nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. Urinary tract symptoms are less common. Patients  with  a  redundant  sigmoid  colon,  of Asian  descent,  or with right-sided disease may complain of pain in the suprapubic area or right lower quadrant. The presentation can mimic other diseases, such as appendicitis.

Patients have a low-grade fever, but the temperature may be higher in patients with generalized peritonitis and in those with an abscess. Physical findings range from mild abdominal tenderness to severe pain, obstruction, and peritonitis. Occult blood may be present in the stool.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The differential diagnosis includes acute appendicitis, colitis (ischemic or infectious),  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (Crohn's  disease  or  ulcerative colitis), colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, pseudomembranous colitis, epiploic appendagitis, gallbladder disease, incarcerated hernia, mesenteric infarction, complicated ulcer disease, peritonitis, obstruction, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cyst or mass, pelvic inflammatory disease,  sarcoidosis,  collagen  vascular  disease,  cystitis,  kidney  stone,  renal pathology, and pancreatic disease.

Diverticulitis  can  be  diagnosed  by  clinical  history  and  examination alone.  In  stable  patients  with  past  similar  acute  presentations,  no  further diagnostic evaluation is necessary unless the patient fails to improve with conservative medical treatment. If a patient does not have a prior diagnosis or the current episode is different from past episodes, diagnostic imaging should be performed to rule out other intraabdominal pathology and evaluate  for  complications.  CT  scan  is  the  preferred  imaging  modality  for  its ability to evaluate the severity of disease and the presence of complications. CT  with  IV  and  oral  contrast  has  documented  sensitivities  of  97%  and specificities approaching 100%. Compression ultrasound is operator dependent  and  has  been  shown  to  have  sensitivity  and  specificity  greater  than 80% with experienced operators.  Laboratory  tests,  such  as  a  CBC,  liver function tests, and urinalysis, are not diagnostic but may help exclude other diagnoses.

Intestinal obstruction results from mechanical blockage or the loss of normal peristalsis. Adynamic or paralytic ileus is more common and usually selflimiting. Common causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction (SBO) are adhesions  due  to  previous  surgery,  incarcerated  hernias,  or  inflammatory diseases. Other causes to consider are inflammatory bowel diseases, congenital  anomalies,  and  foreign  bodies. The  most  frequent  causes  of  large bowel obstructions are cancer, diverticulitis with stricture, sigmoid volvulus, and fecal impaction. Consider intussusception in children. Sigmoid volvulus is  more  common  in  the  elderly  taking  anticholinergic  medications  while cecal volvulus is more common in gravid patients. Intestinal pseudoobstruction  (Ogilvie  syndrome) may mimic large bowel obstruction. The elderly and bedridden and patients taking anticholinergic medications or tricyclic antidepressants are at increased risk for pseudoobstruction.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Crampy, intermittent, progressive abdominal pain and inability to have a bowel movement or to pass flatus are common presenting complaints. Vomiting, bilious in proximal obstructions and feculent in distal obstruction, is usually  present.  Patients  with  partial  SBO  can  still  pass  flatus.  Physical signs vary from abdominal distention, localized or general tenderness, to obvious  signs  of  peritonitis.  Localization  of  pain  and  the  presence  of abdominal surgical scars, hernia, or masses may provide clues to the site of obstruction. The abdomen may be tympanitic to percussion. Active, highpitched bowel sounds can be heard in mechanical SBO. Bowel sounds may be diminished or absent if the obstruction has been present for many hours. Rectal examination may demonstrate fecal impaction, rectal carcinoma, or occult blood. Key features of ileus and mechanical bowel obstruction are described  in  Table  45-1.  The  presence  of  stool  in  the  rectum  does  not exclude obstruction.  Consider  a  pelvic  examination  in  women.  Systemic symptoms and signs depend on the extent of dehydration and the presence of bowel necrosis or infection.

# DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Suspect intestinal obstruction in any patient with abdominal pain, distention, and vomiting, especially in patients with previous abdominal surgery, abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy, or groin hernias.

Flat and upright abdominal radiographs and an upright chest x-ray can screen for obstruction (see Fig. 45-1), confirm severe constipation, or diagnose hollow viscous perforation with free air. The diagnostic procedure of choice in the ED is CT scanning using IV and oral contrast when possible. CT scanning can delineate partial versus complete bowel obstruction, partial SBO versus ileus, and strangulated versus simple SBO.

Laboratory  tests  may  include  a  complete  blood  count,  electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate levels, coagulation profile, and type and cross-match. Suspect abscess, gangrene, or peritonitis if leukocytosis > 20,000  or  left  shift  is  noted. An  elevated  hematocrit  is  consistent  with dehydration.

# Hernia in Adults and Children Louise Finnel

A hernia is a protrusion of any viscus from its normal cavity, for example, bowel bulging through the abdominal wall. Hernias are classified by anatomic location, hernia contents, and the status of those contents (e.g., reducible, incarcerated, or strangulated). The most common abdominal hernias are inguinal, ventral, and femoral hernias (Fig. 46-1).

Predisposing  factors  include  family  history,  lack  of  developmental maturity, undescended testes, genitourinary abnormalities, conditions that increase  intraabdominal  pressure  (e.g.,  ascites  or  pregnancy),  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and surgical incision sites.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Most hernias are detected on routine physical examination or inadvertently by the patient. When the contents of a hernia can be easily returned to their original cavity by manipulation, the hernia is defined as reducible . A hernia becomes incarcerated when  its  contents  are  not  reducible.  Incarcerated hernias  may  lead  to  bowel  obstruction  and  strangulation. Strangulation refers to vascular compromise of the incarcerated contents and is an acute surgical emergency. When not relieved, strangulation may lead to gangrene, perforation, peritonitis, and septic shock.

Symptoms other than an obvious protruding mass from the abdominal wall include localized pain, nausea, and vomiting. Signs of strangulation include severe pain and tenderness, induration, and erythema over the site. Children may exhibit irritability and poor feeding. Careful evaluation for obstruction is essential.

262

CHAPTER 46: Hernia in Adults and Children

263

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Physical examination is the predominant means of diagnosis. Laboratory testing is of minimal value. Ultrasonographic detection of hernias is operator and body habitus dependent but can be helpful in pediatric and pregnant patients  where  radiation  exposure  is  a  concern  (Fig.  46-2).  Computed tomography remains the best radiographic test for the evaluation of hernias and can more easily identify the less common hernia types such as Spigelian or obturator.

The  differential  diagnosis  of  a  groin  mass  includes  direct  or  indirect hernia, testicular torsion, tumor, groin abscess, hydrocele, varicocele, and hidradenitis. In children, retracted or undescended testes may be mistaken for inguinal hernias.

Anorectal disorders range from simple local disease processes to underlying serious systemic disorders. Most anorectal diseases originate in the anal crypts,  glands,  internal  hemorrhoidal  plexus,  and  external  hemorrhoid veins. More serious life-threatening infections tend to lie in the deeper tissues such as the ischiorectal and pelvic-rectal spaces.

After a detailed history, a digital examination of the rectum should be performed, followed by anoscopy in the left lateral decubitus position. The supine or lithotomy position can be used for debilitated patients.

# ■ ANAL TAGS

Skin tags are usually asymptomatic minor projections of the skin at the anal verge, which may be from residual prior hemorrhoids. Most are asymptomatic but inflammation may cause itching or pain. Inflammatory bowel disease may be associated with sentinel tags; therefore, surgical referral is warranted.

# ■ HEMORRHOIDS

Engorgement, prolapse, or thrombosis of the internal or external hemorrhoidal vein(s) is termed hemorrhoids.

# Clinical Features

Patients report painless, bright red rectal blood on the surface of the stool, toilet tissue, or dripping into the toilet bowl after defecation. Thrombosed hemorrhoids are usually painful and may appear as a bluish-purple mass protruding from the rectum. Large hemorrhoids may result in prolapse that may spontaneously reduce or require periodic manual reduction by patients or clinicians. They may become incarcerated and gangrenous, and require surgical intervention. Prolapse may cause mucous discharge and pruritus. If not reduced, severe bleeding, thrombosis, infarction, incarceration, urinary retention, or sepsis may occur.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Internal  hemorrhoids  are  not  readily  palpable  and  are  best  visualized through an anoscope. They are found at 2, 5, and 9 o'clock positions when patients are prone. Constipation, pregnancy, ascites, ovarian tumors, radiation fibrosis, and increased portal venous pressure are some of the common causes of hemorrhoids. Rectal and sigmoid colon tumors should be considered in patients older than 40 years.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Unless a complication is present, management is usually nonsurgical.

265

--- Page 286 ---

266 SECTION 6:  Gastrointestinal Emergencies

# ■ CRYpTITIS

Sphincter spasm, and superficial trauma from diarrhea, or repeated passage of large hard stools cause breakdown of the mucosa over the crypts. Infecting  organisms  enter  the  crypts  and  cause  inflammation  of  anal glands, abscesses formation, fissures, and fistulae. Common symptoms include anal pain during bowel movements and itching, with or without rectal bleeding. Diagnosis is made by palpation of tender, swollen crypts with associated hypertrophied papillae. Anoscopy allows visualization of the inflamed crypts in posterior midline of the anal ring. Bulk laxatives, additional roughage, hot sitz baths, and warm rectal irrigations enhance healing. Surgical treatment may be needed in refractory cases.

# ■ ANAL FISSURES

Anal fissures are superficial linear tears of the anal canal usually caused by local trauma (e.g., passage of hard stool) and are the most common cause of painful rectal bleeding.

# Clinical Features

Patients  complain  of  sharp  cutting  pain  with  defecation  that  subsides between  bowel  movements.  Bleeding  is  bright  and  in  small  quantities. Rectal examination is very painful and often not possible without application of topical anesthetic agents. Most fissures are located in the posterior midline. A sentinel pile may be noted in patients with chronic fissures. A non-posterior midline fissure should alert the physician to consider serious causes,  such  as  Crohn's  disease,  ulcerative  colitis,  carcinomas,  AIDS, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases.

Treatment is aimed at relieving sphincter spasm and pain, and preventing stricture formation. Hot sitz baths and the addition of bran (fiber) to the diet are helpful. Use of topical analgesics or steroids may be temporarily helpful. Surgical excision of the fissure may be required if the area does not heal in 6 weeks after adequate treatment.

CHAPTER 47: Anorectal Disorders 267

268 SECTION 6:  Gastrointestinal Emergencies

# ■ FISTULA IN ANO

An  anal  fistula  is  an  abnormal  inflammatory  tract,  originating  from  an infected anal gland. Fistulae commonly result from perianal or ischiorectal abscess. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, tuberculosis, gonococcal proctitis, and carcinomas should also be considered in the etiology. Persistent bloody, malodorous discharge occurs as long as the fistula remains open. Blockage of the tract causes recurrent bouts of inflammation and abscess formation.

Ultrasonography  with  a  7  MHz  endoprobe  and  enhanced  with  3% hydrogen peroxide may aid in the diagnosis. Non-ill appearing patients can be treated with analgesics, antipyretics, and oral antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg four times daily for 7 days. Sitz baths and local cleaning will temporize the condition before surgery.  Surgical  excision  is  the  definitive  treatment  and  should  not  be delayed in ill-appearing patients.

# ■ ANORECTAL ABSCESSES

Abscesses  start  from  the  anal  crypts  and  spread  to  involve  the  perianal, intersphincteric, ischiorectal, or deep perianal space. Perianal abscess is the most common and found at the anal verge (Fig. 47-2).

# Clinical Features

Persistent dull, aching, throbbing pain that increases prior to defecation is typical. As the abscess progresses, pain and tenderness interfere with walking or sitting. Fever, leukocytosis, and a painful tender mass may be present upon digital rectal examination.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Simple  isolated  perianal  abscess  without  systemic  illness  may  be  safely incised  in  the  ED.  Other  perirectal  abscesses,  such  as  supralevator  or ischiorectal abscesses, should be drained in the operating room. After adequate  local  and  systemic  analgesia,  a  cruciate  incision  is  made  over  the abscess, and the 'dog ears' are excised. Packing usually is not required. Sitz baths should be started the next day. Antibiotics usually are not necessary unless systemic infection or toxicity is present.

# ■ pROCTITIS

Proctitis  is  inflammation  of  the  rectal  mucosa.  Common  causes  include prior  radiation  treatments,  autoimmune  disorders,  vasculitis,  ischemia, sexually transmitted infections (e.g., syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, lymphogranuloma venereum, herpes simplex, chancroid, human papillomavirus), and other infectious diseases.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms include  anorectal  pain,  itching,  discharge,  diarrhea,  bleeding, and lower abdominal cramping. Mucosal inflammation, erythema, bleeding, ulcers, or discharge may be noted during anoscopy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Obtain  cultures  if  an  infectious  cause  is  suspected.  Stool  softeners,  sitz baths, good anal hygiene, and analgesics will provide some relief. Patient with  enteric  pathogens  and  sexually  transmitted  infections  will  require

--- Page 290 ---

270 SECTION 6:  Gastrointestinal Emergencies

antibiotics directed at the suspected underlying pathogen. Arrange outpatient follow-up.

# ■ RECTAL pROLApSE

Prolapse (procidentia) may involve the mucosa alone or all layers of the rectum.  In  addition,  intussusception  of  the  rectum  may  present  as  a prolapse.

# Clinical Features

Most patients complain of protruding mass, mucous discharge, associated bleeding, and pruritus. Partial prolapse involves only the rectal mucosa and tends to protrude only a few centimeters from the dentate line. Complete prolapse involves all layers of the rectum, and appears like a red, ball-like mass and may extend up to 15 cm. Often, pain is not a significant feature.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

In children, the prolapse can be gently reduced under proper analgesia and sedation.  The  child  should  then  be  referred  to  a  specialist  to  ensure  the prolapse is not due to an underlying condition. Every effort should be made to  prevent  the  child  from  being  constipated.  In  adults,  reduction  can be  more  difficult  if  the  rectal  walls  have  become  edematous.  Generous amounts of granulated sugar applied 15 minutes prior to the reduction may aid in the process with direct, continuous pressure. Lubricated gauze should be taped in place over the anal verge for a few hours after reduction. If the prolapse cannot be easily reduced, or there is evidence of ischemia, emergency surgical consultation and hospitalization are warranted.

# ■ ANORECTAL TUMORS

Factors such as smoking, anal intercourse, HIV, and genital warts are associated with anorectal cancer. Neoplasms that occur in this group include adenocarcinoma,  malignant  melanoma,  and  Kaposi's  sarcoma.  Patients present with nonspecific symptoms including sensation of a mass, pruritus, pain, and blood on the stool. Constipation, anorexia, weight loss, narrowing of  the  stool  caliber,  and  tenesmus  eventually  develop. Anal  margin  neoplasms frequently present as an ulcer that fails to heal in a timely manner. Virtually all anorectal tumors can be detected by careful visual examination of the perianal area, digital palpation of the distal rectum and anal canal, and  procto-  or  sigmoidoscopic  examination.  Complications  of  anorectal tumors include rectal prolapse, prolonged blood loss, perirectal abscesses, or fistulae. Refer all patients for proctoscopic or sigmoidoscopic examination  and  biopsy  if  the  history  or  physical  examination  is  suspicious  for neoplasms.

# ■ RECTAL FOREIGN BODIES

Not all patients are forthcoming with accurate history of rectal foreign body insertion.  Patients  may  instead  complain  of  abdominal  pain,  anorectal bleeding, or discharge.

--- Page 291 ---

CHAPTER 47: Anorectal Disorders

271

# Clinical Features

Most foreign bodies are in the rectal ampulla and are palpable through digital  and  proctoscopic  examination.  Obtain  abdominal  and  pelvis x-rays to demonstrate the position, shape, and number of foreign bodies. An  upright  film  or  CT  scan  may  be  useful  to  visualize  a  radiolucent foreign body and to detect free air, indicative of perforation.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Although some low-lying rectal foreign bodies can be removed in the ED, many require surgical consultation and intervention, especially if they are made of glass or contain sharp edges.

# ■ pRURITUS ANI

Pruritus ani can occur from a variety of anal and systemic problems. Common causes include diet, infectious agents, irritants, and tight-fitting undergarments. Pinworms ( Enterobius vermicularis ) are the most common cause of anal pruritus in children. The skin appears normal in early mild cases. In severe exacerbations the perianal area will appear reddened, excoriated, and moist. Increased fiber, sitz baths, antihistamines, zinc oxide ointment, or 1% hydrocortisone cream can be used to treat acute symptoms and enhance healing. Any underlying cause should also be treated. Consider referral to proctologist or dermatologist for resistant cases.

# ■ pILONIDAL SINUS

Pilonidal sinuses or cysts occur in the midline in the upper part of the natal cleft, which overlies the lower sacrum and coccyx. A pilonidal sinus is usually caused by foreign body granuloma reaction to ingrowing hair. Because of their proximity to the anus, infected pilonidal cysts (abscesses) are sometimes mistakenly diagnosed as perirectal abscesses.

--- Page 292 ---

272 SECTION 6:  Gastrointestinal Emergencies

# Clinical Features

Pilonidal disease may present as a painless cyst, an infected abscess, or a chronic  recurring  cyst  with  drainage  in  the  posterior  midline  over  the sacrum and coccyx. Ultrasound can be used to determine the extent of the abscess before incision and drainage.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Acute  infections  may  be  drained  in  the  ED  and  packed.  The  patient  is placed prone and the buttocks are retracted. After appropriate sedation and local anesthesia, the abscess is drained and loculations are gently broken. The wound is packed loosely with gauze, and a bulky dressing is applied. The patient is advised to start sitz baths the following day. Antibiotics or cultures  usually  are  not  necessary,  unless  the  patient  is  immunocompromised or there is evidence of surrounding cellulitis.

# Jaundice, Hepatic Disorders, and Hepatic Failure

Cem Oktay

# ■ JAUNDICE

Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of skin, sclera, and mucous membranes resulting from the elevated levels of bilirubin in the circulation, usually presents at levels of > 2.5 mg/dL. Hyperbilirubinemia occurs as a result  of  (1)  overproduction  (e.g.,  hemolysis),  (2)  inadequate  cellular processing (e.g., infections, drugs, toxins), or (3) decreased excretion of bilirubin (e.g., pancreatic tumor, gallstone in the common bile duct). The causes  of  jaundice  can  also  be  classified  as  prehepatic,  hepatic,  and posthepatic.

Hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into two types: Unconjugated form results  from  the  increased  production  of  bilirubin  or  the  impaired  liver's ability  to  conjugate  bilirubin.  Conjugated  form  occurs  as  a  result  of impaired excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the setting of intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis.

# Clinical Features

Previously  healthy  young  patients  with  acute  hepatitis  typically  presents with a sudden onset of jaundice and a prodrome of fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting,  and  right  upper  quadrant  abdominal  pain  resulting  from  the enlarged liver.

History of excessive alcohol consumption suggests alcoholic hepatitis. Jaundice usually develops gradually in the setting of alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis.

Symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, and malaise associated with painless jaundice in older patients classically suggest hepatobiliary or pancreatic malignancy.

Liver metastases are suspected in patients with primary tumors and an enlarged, hard, tender, nodular liver accompanied by jaundice.

Inherited diseases such as Gilbert syndrome, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, can be the cause of jaundice when a family history of jaundice or a history of recurrent mild jaundice that spontaneously resolves or seen in response to a number of triggers such as certain foods, illness, or medication is present.

Jaundice can be seen in patients with the clinical signs and symptoms of cholecystitis in the setting of a retained gallstone in the common bile duct.

Patients with a history of biliary tract surgery, pancreatitis, cholangitis, or  inflammatory  bowel  present  with  jaundice  due  to  the  development  of biliary tract scaring or strictures.

Jaundice can be seen in patients with hepatomegaly, pedal edema, jugular venous distention, and a gallop rhythm due to the passive congestion of liver or acute ischemic hepatitis in patients with chronic heart failure.

273

--- Page 294 ---

274 SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

# Diagnosis and Differential

A detailed history, a carefully conducted physical examination, and routine laboratory tests lead to accurate diagnosis in 85% of patients with jaundice. Initial laboratory tests include serum bilirubin level (total and direct (conjugated)  fractions;  indirect  (unconjugated)  fraction  can  be  calculated  by subtraction), serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, a complete  blood  count  (CBC),  and  urinalysis  to  check  for  bilirubin  and urobilinogen. Additional laboratory tests are ordered according to the clinical  features  to  diagnose  specific  causes.  These  include  serum  lipase  or amylase  levels,  prothrombin  time  (PT),  electrolytes  and  glucose  levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, γ -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), albumin, viral hepatitis panels, drug levels, and pregnancy test.

An increased total and indirect bilirubin signifies either an overproduction  or  an  injury  to  hepatocytes  themselves.  Total  and  direct  bilirubin  is increased when there is some obstruction preventing the secretion of the conjugated bilirubin.

Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are released into the circulation when there is hepatocyte injury or necrosis. The pattern of elevations in serum transaminases suggests the etiology of hepatocellular disease such as viral hepatitis, toxin- or drug-induced hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Enzyme levels may be near normal in the end-stage liver failure. Jaundice is more likely to be caused by sepsis or systemic infection, pregnancy, or inborn errors of metabolism, when transaminase levels are in normal range.

Hemolysis and hemoglobinopathy are considered when anemia is present in addition to normal liver transaminase levels; Coombs test and hemoglobin electrophoresis may be useful in diagnosis.

ALP  elevation  is  associated  with  biliary  obstruction  and  cholestasis. Serum GGT level is increased by alcohol consumption and drugs including hepatic microsomal enzyme activity.

Ultrasonogram of the liver, biliary tract, and pancreas is helpful in diagnosing an obstructive cause, or a mass or tumor in the liver, pancreas, and portal region. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to ultrasound (US) in detecting pancreatic or intraabdominal tumors. However, CT is more costly than and has similar sensitivity to US for detection of gallstones.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment  depends  on  the  cause  of  the  underlying  condition  leading  to jaundice and any potential complications related to it.

Treatment is largely supportive; isotonic IV fluid therapy is administered if the patient is dehydrated. IV antibiotics are required since septic shock may develop expeditiously in patients  with  ascending  cholangitis. Patients with extrahepatic obstructive jaundice without cholangitis should be admitted for drainage.

If  the  appropriate  laboratory  tests  have  been  done  in  the  emergency department (ED), further outpatient workup and treatment are appropriate when  the  patient  is  hemodynamically  stable  and  has  no  evidence  of hepatic failure or acute biliary obstruction. However, the patient should also be reliable to present the timely follow-up and has adequate social support.

# ■ hEpAtIC DISOrDErS

Specific entities addressed in this chapter include acute hepatitis, chronic liver disease, and complications of cirrhosis including ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatic encephalopathy.

# ■ ACUtE hEpAtItIS

Hepatitis  is  an  inflammation  of  the  liver  owing  to  infectious,  toxic,  or metabolic injury to hepatocytes. Patients can present to the ED anywhere along the spectrum of the disease from asymptomatic infection to an acute, or fulminant, liver failure to chronic cirrhosis. The most common causes are viral infection and toxic ingestion.

# Clinical Features

Acute hepatitis typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant  abdominal  pain. The  patient  with  acute  hepatitis  can  also  have fever, diarrhea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, and an enlarged, tender liver. The presence  of  altered  mental  status,  abnormal  bleeding  (bruising,  bleeding gums, epistaxis, blood in the stool), ascites, and lower body edema suggests chronic disease or a fulminant liver failure.

Paying  attention  to  the  historical  clues  and  risk  factors  is  crucial  in determining the etiology of hepatitis. Ingestion of acetaminophen (in onetime  overdose  or  chronically  high  doses),  mushrooms,  raw  oysters,  and herbal remedies should be assessed in the history. Risk factors in the past medical  history  include  chronic  hepatitis,  transfusion  of  blood  products, positive human immunodeficiency virus status, frequent use of pain medications,  or  depression.  A  social  history  positive  for  injection  drug  use, chronic  alcohol  abuse,  sexual  promiscuity,  or  travel  to  countries  with endemic parasitic liver diseases represents increased risk for liver disease.

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted by fecal-oral contamination that is associated with improper food handling. The most common transmission occurs from asymptomatic children to adults.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted sexually, by blood transfusion, by contaminated needles, and by perinatal transmission.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission occurs primarily through exposure to contaminated blood or blood products. HBV and HCV can lead to chronic infection, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Other  hepatotropic  viruses  such  as  Hepatitis  D  and  E  viruses,  cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, coxsackievirus, and Epstein-Barr virus can cause acute hepatitis.

Toxic  insults  to  the  liver  can  cause  acute  hepatitis  and  fulminant  liver failure. In addition to the most common toxic insult of acetaminophen, alcohol,  a  variety  of  prescription  medications  (e.g.,  certain  antibiotics,  statins, isoniazid), herbal remedies (e.g., black cohosh, chaparral, Echinacea, kava), and dietary supplements are associated with acute hepatitis and liver failure.

The clinical presentation of infectious hepatitis varies with the individual as well as with the specific causative virus. Asymptomatic incubation period is followed by a prodrome of nausea, vomiting, and malaise. Later on, patients may note dark urine (bilirubinuria) and clay-colored stools and jaundice.

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

Alcoholic  liver  disease  can  range  from  asymptomatic,  reversible  fatty liver to acute alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or a combination of acute and cirrhotic features. Acute alcoholic hepatitis develops in patients with asymptomatic liver disease (fatty liver can be seen on imaging) if they continue drinking. These patients may complain of gradual onset of anorexia, nausea, fever, dark urine, jaundice, weight loss, abdominal pain, and generalized weakness.

Fulminant hepatic failure is generally used to describe the development of encephalopathy within 8 weeks of the onset of symptoms in a patient with a previously  healthy  liver.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  failure  may  include encephalopathy, cerebral edema, jaundice, ascites, right upper quadrant tenderness, and coagulopathy. Clinical features of hepatitis are listed in Table 48-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Traditional liver  function  panels  include  a  mix  of  markers  of  hepatocyte injury, usually include AST, ALT, and ALP, as well as indicators of hepatocyte catabolic activity (direct and indirect bilirubin).

Elevations of transaminases in the hundreds of units per liter suggest mild injury, or smoldering inflammation. Levels in the thousands suggest extensive acute hepatic necrosis. Acute viral hepatitis may cause the levels of ALT to rise several thousand units per liter. Less significant elevations, less than five times normal, are typical of alcoholic liver disease. ALT is a more specific marker of hepatocyte injury than AST. Patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis have AST and ALT levels that rise to several hundred units  per  liter.  A  relative  predominance  of  AST  to  ALT  is  expected  in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

ALP  elevation  is  associated  with  biliary  obstruction  and  cholestasis; elevations greater than four times normal strongly suggest cholestasis.

An elevated GGT in the setting of hepatitis suggests an alcoholic cause. It is also elevated by drugs such as phenobarbital and warfarin. It may rise in  acute  and  chronic  pancreatitis,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  uremia, COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific marker, which limits its utility.

Serum glucose level  should  immediately  be  checked  in  patients  with altered mental status because severe hepatocellular injury can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoxia, sepsis, intoxication,  intracranial  lesions,  or  encephalopathy should also be considered in such a state.

Since nausea and vomiting may result in volume depletion and dehydration,  serum  electrolytes,  BUN,  and  creatinine  levels  should  be checked.

An elevated serum ammonia level is seen in patients with hepatic metabolic failure caused by acute and chronic liver diseases. Very high ammonia levels signify poor prognosis.

Prothrombin time serves as a true measure of liver function. Prolonged PT or elevated INR occurs in acute hepatitis and exacerbations of chronic compensated  liver  disease;  however,  it  is  a  common  complication  of advancing cirrhosis and indicates significant liver dysfunction and a poor prognosis.

Albumin  reflects  the  liver's  synthetic  function  and  may  decrease  in advancing cirrhosis or severe acute hepatitis. Low albumin suggests a poor short-term prognosis.

Serum bilirubin is somewhat insensitive for liver dysfunction. Hyperbilirubinemia in acute viral hepatitis varies in severity, and fractionation has no clinical value. However, the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia in primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute liver failure suggests a poor prognosis.

Viral hepatitis serologies are often grouped into screening panels by hospital laboratories; however, these tests are rarely immediately available. Detection of immunoglobulin M anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies is standard  for  diagnosing  acute  infection  with  hepatitis  A  virus.  Acute clinical  illness  in  hepatitis  B  virus  correlates  with  positive  hepatitis  B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). Hepatitis C virus is confirmed with positive anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibodies; however, this diagnosis

--- Page 298 ---

278

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

may be masked by the 6- to 8-week delay between infection and antibody detection.

A CBC may be useful in detecting anemia, which suggests alcoholic hepatitis,  decompensated  cirrhosis,  gastrointestinal  bleeding,  or  a  hemolytic  process.  Although  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count  is  not  useful  in diagnosis,  a  transient  neutropenia  followed  by  a  relative  lymphocytosis with atypical forms is seen with viral hepatitis.

The serum acetaminophen concentration is the basis for diagnosis and treatment in patients with the suspicion of toxic ingestion.

Differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis include viral hepatitis, drug- or toxin-induced  hepatitis,  alcoholic  hepatitis,  autoimmune  hepatitis,  cholecystitis and cholangitis, HELLP syndrome, hepatic, pancreatic, or biliary tumors, and metastatic liver diseases.

# ■ CIrrhOSIS AND ChrONIC LIVEr FAILUrE

Cirrhosis is a chronic degenerative disease in which a critical amount of liver parenchyma is replaced by fibrotic tissue. Cirrhosis is often caused by alcoholic or chronic viral hepatitis; less common causes include drugs or toxins, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and primary (idiopathic) biliary cirrhosis.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms of cirrhosis develop gradually. Patients with cirrhosis may be asymptomatic  or  have  nonspecific  constitutional  symptoms,  such  as fatigue, loss of appetite, general weakness, muscle wasting, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. Signs and symptoms of decompensation include abdominal distension due to ascites and hepatomegaly, altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy, pedal edema, jaundice, pruritus, splenomegaly, and spider angiomata.

Ascites, which is one of the hallmarks of cirrhosis, causes a protuberant abdomen. Intra-abdominal fluid  can  displace  the  diaphragm  upward  and produce pleural effusion with the possibility of respiratory compromise.

Hepatic  encephalopathy  causes  a  spectrum  of  illness  ranging  from chronic fatigue or mild confusion to acute lethargy. Hyperreflexia, spasticity, generalized seizure, and coma may also be present.

Patients with cirrhosis often present to the ED with worsening ascites and edema, altered mental status, abdominal pain resulting from complications such as SBP, gastrointestinal and variceal bleeding, and other concurrent infections including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.

Spontaneous  bacterial  peritonitis  is  a  subtle  crucial  complication  of ascites; however, it is difficult to diagnose because signs of abdominal pain and fever are not always present, and physical examination does not always demonstrate abdominal tenderness.

Hepatorenal syndrome is a complication of cirrhosis that often accompanies SBP. This syndrome is defined as functional renal failure in cirrhotic patients in the absence of intrinsic renal disease.

Hepatic  encephalopathy  may  be  worsened  or  precipitated  by  protein load from a large meal or from occult GI bleeding. Progressive liver disease, constipation, hypo- or hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, alcohol withdrawal, hypoperfusion states such as sepsis, renal failure, medications such as antibiotics, and iatrogenic interventions can also compromise the liver's metabolic capacity and results in hepatic encephalopathy.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Laboratory  tests  include  transaminases  (AST  and  ALT),  ALP,  total  and direct  bilirubin,  LDH,  albumin,  ammonia,  glucose,  BUN  and  creatinine, electrolytes, PT/INR, and CBC. Transaminases may be near normal in the end-stage liver failure. PT and albumin reflects the liver's synthetic function. Prolonged PT is a common complication of advanced cirrhosis. Albumin may decrease in advanced cirrhosis. High ammonia is a sign of hepatic encephalopathy; however, levels of ammonia do not reliably correlate with mental status. Elevated serum ammonia levels do not obviate a thorough search for other multiple causes of altered mental status in patients with cirrhosis.

--- Page 300 ---

280

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

Patients who are diagnosed with ascites for the first time, or who have ascites and develop fever, abdominal pain, GI bleeding, or encephalopathy should undergo paracentesis to check for SBP. A 50 cc sample of ascitic fluid should be obtained for cell count, glucose and protein, Gram stain, and culture to identify bacterial peritonitis.

A total WBC count > 1000/mm 3   or  a  neutrophil  count > 250/mm 3   is consistent with a diagnosis of SBP.

A 10 mL of ascitic fluid should be placed in a blood culture bottle at the bedside for best results. The most common isolates in SBP are Enterobacteriaceae ( Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae , etc.-63%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (15%).

Bedside US can identify ascites and guide paracentesis (Fig. 48-1). US with duplex Doppler is the test of choice for identifying portal vein and hepatic vein thrombosis. Cancerous, vascular, or infectious lesions of the liver  can  be  identified  with  US  and  abdominal CT. Consider obtaining a head CT to identify intracranial hemorrhage in patients with altered mental status.

As an increasing number of surgical procedures occur in outpatient settings and  inpatient  lengths  of  stay  decrease,  the  emergency  physician  will encounter more postoperative patients and their complications. Common clinical situations presenting to the emergency department include: fever, respiratory  complications,  genitourinary  complaints,  wound  infections, vascular problems, and complications of drug therapy. Specific problems not covered in other chapters of this book are discussed here.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

# Fever

The causes of postoperative fever are the 5 Ws: wind (respiratory), water (urinary tract infection [UTI]), wound, walking (deep venous thrombosis [DVT]),  and  wonder  drugs  (drug  fever  or  pseudomembranous  colitis [PMC]). Fever in the first 24 hours is usually due to atelectasis, but wound infections with necrotizing fasciitis, or clostridial infections must also be considered. In the first 72 hours, pneumonia, atelectasis, intravenous catheter-related thrombophlebitis, and infections are the major causes. UTIs are seen 1 to 5 days postoperatively. DVT does not typically occur until 5 days after the procedure, and wound infections generally manifest 7 to 10 days after surgery. Antibiotic-induced PMC is seen 6 weeks after surgery.

# Respiratory Complications

Postoperative pain, splinting, and inadequate clearance of secretions lead to atelectasis. Fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and mild hypoxia may be seen. Pneumonia may develop 24 to 96 hours later (see Chapter 30). Pulmonary embolism can occur any time postoperatively (see Chapter 25).

# Genitourinary Complications

UTIs occur after any procedure, but more commonly after instrumentation of the GU tract or bladder catheterization. Elderly men, patients undergoing anorectal or prolonged operations, and those receiving spinal or epidural anesthesia are at increased risk for urinary retention presenting with lower abdominal  pain  and  the  inability  to  urinate  (see  Chapter  54).  Decreased urine output should raise concerns for renal failure resulting from multiple causes, particularly volume depletion (see Chapter 50).

# Wound Complications

Hematomas with pain and swelling at the surgical site result from inadequate hemostasis. A small portion of the wound may be opened to rule out infection. Seromas are collections of clear fluid under the wound. Wound infections present with pain, swelling, erythema drainage and tenderness. Risk  factors  include  extremes  of  age,  diabetes,  poor  nutrition,  necrotic

282

--- Page 303 ---

CHAPTER 49: Complications of General Surgical Procedures

283

tissue, poor perfusion, foreign bodies, and hematomas. Necrotizing fasciitis should be considered in a systemically ill patient with rapidly expanding infection  and  pain  out  of  proportion  to  examination  (see  Chapter  90). Superficial  or  deep  fascial  wound  dehiscence  can  occur  due  to  diabetes, poor nutrition, chronic steroid use, and inadequate or improper closure of the wound. Operative exploration may be required to determine the extent of dehiscence.

# Vascular Complications

Superficial  thrombophlebitis  manifests  with  erythema,  warmth,  and  fullness of the affected vein. It usually occurs in the upper extremities after intravenous catheter insertion or in the lower extremities due to stasis in varicosities. DVT most commonly occurs in the lower extremities postoperatively (see Chapter 25).

# Drug Therapy Complications

Numerous medications cause fever without associated concomitant infection.  Many  antibiotics  prescribed  perioperatively  can  cause  antibioticinduced diarrhea. PMC, the most serious diarrheal complication, is caused by Clostridium difficile toxin. Watery or even bloody diarrhea, fever, and crampy abdominal pain are the usual complaints.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Postoperative patients with fever should have an evaluation focusing on the elements detailed above. Patients with suspected respiratory complications should have chest x-rays. Radiographs may demonstrate atelectasis, pneumonia, or pneumothorax. Additional imaging like CT or ultrasound may be indicated based on the operative procedure performed.

Patients with oliguria or anuria should be evaluated for signs of hypovolemia or urinary retention. Diagnosis of PMC is established by demonstrating C difficile cytotoxin  in  the  stool.  Nevertheless,  in  27%  of  cases,  the assay may be negative.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Contact the surgeon who performed the procedure to discuss patients who present with postoperative complications. Patients who are toxic appearing, have underlying debilitating conditions or elderly require hospitalization.

--- Page 304 ---

284

SECTION 6: Gastrointestinal Emergencies

Seromas can be confirmed and treated with needle aspiration. Admission may not be necessary for either of these processes.

# ■ SpECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

# Complications of Breast Surgery

Although overall rates of complications are low following breast surgery, wound infections, hematomas, seromas, pneumothorax, and necrosis of the skin flaps may be seen. Lymphedema of the ipsilateral arm may occur after mastectomy.

# Complications of Gastrointestinal Surgery

Stimulation of the splanchnic nerves during intraabdominal surgery may lead  to  dysmotility  and  a  paralytic  ileus.  After  gastrointestinal  surgery, small bowel tone returns to normal within 24 hours and colonic function within 3 to 5 days.

Patients develop nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention and pain. An adynamic ileus typically resolves after bowel rest, nasogastric suction and intravenous hydration. Prolonged ileus should prompt an  investigation  for  nonneuronal  causes  like  peritonitis,  intra-abdominal abscesses, hemoperitoneum, pneumonia, sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, or medications. Abdominal imaging, complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should be obtained. Occasionally, surgical intervention may be necessary for obstruction due to adhesions.

Intraabdominal abscesses are caused by preoperative contamination, intraoperative spillage of bowel contents or postoperative anastomotic leaks. Diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography or ultrasonography. Antibiotic therapy as well as either percutaneous or surgical drainage will be required.

Pancreatitis occurs especially after direct manipulation of the pancreatic duct.  The  clinical  spectrum  extends  from  mild  nausea  and  vomiting  to severe  abdominal  pain  and  hemodynamic  instability.  Complications  like pleural effusion and severe hemorrhage may occur. Serum amylase measurements are not specific and measurement of a lipase is more reliable.

Cholecystitis  and  biliary  colic have  been  reported  as  postoperative complications.  Elderly  patients  are  more  prone  to  develop  acalculous cholecystitis. Characteristic lab findings of an obstructive process may be absent.

--- Page 305 ---

CHAPTER 49: Complications of General Surgical Procedures

285

Fistulas , internal or external, may result from either technical complications or direct bowel injury. Fistulas can lead to electrolyte abnormalities and require surgical consultation and possible hospitalization. Anastomotic leaks occur primarily after esophageal, gastric and colonic procedures and can  cause  devastating  consequences  as  a  result  of  infection.  Esophageal leaks occur within 10 days of the operation and carry very high morbidity and mortality rates.

Complications of bariatric surgery remain common, although mortality after the procedures is low. In the weeks after surgery, patients are at risk for leaks and bleeding. Dumping syndrome is seen in gastric bypass procedures due to the rapid influx of hyperosmolar chyme into the small intestine resulting  in  fluid  sequestration  and  hypovolemia.  Patients  experience nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, palpitations, dizziness, and sometimes syncope. Other complications include gastroesophageal reflux, vitamin and electrolyte deficiencies, ulcers, obstruction, gastric slippage, and band erosion.

Complications of laparoscopic procedures include problems related to pneumoperitoneum,  traumatic  injury  from  insertion  of  the  needle  and trocar, and retained stones after cholecystectomy.

Complications of transabdominal feeding tubes and percutaneous endoscopic  gastrostomy tubes  include  infections,  hemorrhage,  peritonitis, aspiration, wound dehiscence, sepsis, and obstruction of the tube. Dislodged tubes should be replaced with the appropriately sized tube (same type if possible, or a temporary foley catheter).

Acute complications arising from stomas (ileostomy or colostomy) are usually due to technical errors of stoma placement. Later complications can be from the underlying disease, such as Crohn's disease or cancer. Ischemia, necrosis, skin maceration, bleeding, parastomal hernia, and prolapse may be seen.

The most common complications of colonoscopy are  hemorrhage and perforation. Hemorrhage occurs typically due to polypectomy, biopsies, or mucosal lacerations or tearing. Perforation may be immediately apparent or symptoms  may  be  delayed  for  several  hours  to  days.  Upright  chest or abdominal radiographs may reveal free air but CT is most sensitive.

Rectal surgery complications include urinary retention (frequently after hemorrhoidectomy), constipation, prolapse, bleeding, and infections.

Tetanus has been known to occur in surgical wounds although, by far, this rare disease is more common after minor trauma.

# Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

# Acute Kidney Injury

Sum Ambur

Patients  with  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  present  with  a  wide  variety  of manifestations depending on the underlying etiology. AKI can be caused by hypovolemia,  nephrotoxic  medications,  and  anatomic  problems  of  the genitourinary tract. Additional etiologies include cardiac, vascular, thrombotic, glomerular, and renal tubular disorders.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Deterioration  in  renal  function  leads  to  an  excessive  accumulation  of nitrogenous waste products in the serum and significant electrolyte abnormalities.  Patients  usually  have  signs  and  symptoms  of  their  underlying causative disorder but eventually develop stigmata of renal failure. Volume overload, hypertension, pulmonary edema, mental status changes or neurologic symptoms, nausea and vomiting, bone and joint problems, anemia, and  increased  susceptibility  to  infection  (a  leading  cause  of  death)  can occur as patients develop more chronic uremia.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

History  and  physical  examination  usually  provide  clues  to  the  etiology. Signs and symptoms of the underlying causative disorder should be vigorously sought. Physical examination should assess vital signs and volume status, establish urinary tract patency and output, and search for signs of chemical intoxication, drug usage, muscle damage, infection, or associated systemic disease. Diagnostic studies include urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen and  creatinine  levels,  serum  electrolytes,  urinary  sodium  and  creatinine, and urinary osmolality. Analysis of these tests allows most patients to be categorized as prerenal, renal, or postrenal. Fractional excretion of sodium can be calculated to help in this categorization (Table 50-1). Normal urinary sediment may be seen in prerenal and postrenal failure, hemolytic-uremic syndrome,  and  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura.  The  presence  of albumin  may  indicate  glomerulonephritis  or  malignant  hypertension. Granular casts are seen in acute tubular necrosis. Albumin and red blood cell  casts  are  found  in  glomerulonephritis,  malignant  hypertension,  and autoimmune disease. White blood cell casts are seen in interstitial nephritis

and pyelonephritis. Crystals can be present with renal calculi and certain drugs (sulfas, ethylene glycol, and radiocontrast agents). Renal ultrasound is  the  radiologic  procedure  of  choice  in  most  patients  with  renal  failure when upper tract obstruction and hydronephrosis are suspected. Color-flow Doppler can assess renal perfusion and facilitate the diagnosis of large vessel causes of renal failure. Bedside sonography can quickly diagnose some treatable causes and give guidance for fluid resuscitation; inspiratory collapse of the intrahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) can give a good measure of volume status and fluid responsiveness (Fig. 50-1).

Prerenal failure is produced by conditions that decrease renal perfusion and is the most common cause of community-acquired acute renal failure (70% of cases). It is also a common precursor to ischemic and nephrotoxic causes  of  intrinsic  renal  failure.  Common  causes  of  prerenal  failure include hypovolemic states (vomiting/diarrhea, diuretics and other antihypertensives,  reduced  intake),  fluid  sequestration  (cirrhosis,  pancreatitis, burns, septic shock, others), blood loss, or decreased cardiac output from cardiac  dysfunction. Intrinsic  renal  failure has  vascular  and  ischemic etiologies;  glomerular  and  tubulointerstitial  diseases  are  also  causative. Ischemic  renal  failure,  traditionally  known  as  acute  tubular  necrosis (ATN), is now called acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI, due to severe and prolonged prerenal etiologies, causes most cases of intrinsic renal failure. AKI is  also  the  most  common  cause  of  hospital-acquired  renal  failure. Nephrotoxins (both physician prescribed and environmental) are the second most common cause of AKI. Postrenal azotemia occurs primarily in elderly men with high-grade prostatic obstruction. Lesions of the external genitalia (i.e., strictures) are also common causes. Significant permanent

loss of renal function occurs over 10 to 14 days with complete obstruction, and worsens with associated UTI.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Emergency department goals in the initial care of patients with acute renal failure focus on treating the underlying cause with an emphasis on correcting fluid and electrolyte derangements. Efforts should be made to prevent further renal damage and provide supportive care while attempting to establish a diagnosis and facilitating further evaluation and treatment as appropriate. Urine output should be closely monitored and consideration should be given to placement of a Foley catheter. ECG should be performed to evaluate for hyperkalemia-associated changes. Appropriate labs including serum potassium, creatinine, and BUN should be obtained.

# Prerenal Failure

# renal Failure (Intrinsic)

Adequate circulating volume must be restored first; hypovolemia potentiates  and  exacerbates  all  forms  of  renal  failure.  Ischemia  or  nephrotoxic agents  are  the  most  common  causes  of  intrinsic  renal  failure.  History, physical examination, and baseline laboratory tests should provide clues to the diagnosis. Nephrotoxic medications and intravenous contrast should be avoided.

# Postrenal Failure

Establish appropriate urinary drainage; the exact procedure depends on the level of obstruction.

--- Page 311 ---

CHAPTER 50: Acute Kidney Injury

291

# Dialysis

If treatment of the underlying cause fails to improve renal function, or in cases with severe hyperkalemia or hypervolemia, dialysis should be considered.  It  is  prudent  to  consult  with  a  nephrologist  as  soon  as  possible  if urgent dialysis is a consideration.

# Disposition

Patients with new-onset renal failure usually require hospital admission, often to an intensive care unit. Consider transferring patients to another institution  if  nephrology  consultation  and  dialysis  facilities  are  not available.

Rhabdomyolysis is  the  destruction  of  skeletal  muscle,  caused  by  any mechanism  that  results  in  injury  to  myocytes  and  their  membranes. Table 51-1 lists commonly recognized conditions associated with rhabdomyolysis. In general, the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis in adults are alcohol and drugs of abuse, followed by medications, muscle diseases, trauma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, seizures, immobility, infection, strenuous physical activity, and heat-related illness. Multiple causes are present in more than half of patients. In children, rhabdomyolysis is less common and is thought to be more benign.

CHAPTER 51: Rhabdomyolysis

293

# ■ CLINICAL FeAtUreS

Symptoms are usually acute in onset and include myalgias, stiffness, weakness,  malaise,  low-grade  fever,  and  dark  (usually  brown)  urine.  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and tachycardia can occur in severe rhabdomyolysis. Muscle symptoms, however, may be present in only half of cases. Some patients may present with complications of rhabdomyolysis such as acute  renal  failure,  metabolic  derangements,  disseminated  intravascular coagulation, and mechanical complications (e.g., compartment syndrome or peripheral neuropathy) (Table 51-2).

Acute rhabdomyolysis may be present without any of these signs or symptoms and with normal findings on physical examination. For this reason, diagnosis is often made from a significant history, an elevated serum  creatine  kinase  level  or  the  presence  of  dark  urine  on  routine laboratory testing.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFereNtIAL

An elevated serum creatine kinase is the most sensitive and reliable indicator of muscle injury. Diagnosis requires a fivefold or greater increase above the upper threshold of normal serum creatine kinase level in the absence of cardiac  or  brain  injury.  Persistently  elevated  levels  despite  treatment suggest ongoing muscle necrosis.

Myoglobinuria  develops  once  skeletal  muscle  injury  is > 100  gram. Because myoglobin contains heme, qualitative tests such as the dipstick test do not differentiate  among  hemoglobin, myoglobin, and red blood cells. Therefore, suspect myoglobinuria when the urine dipstick test is positive for blood but no red blood cells are present on microscopic examination. Absence of an elevated serum myoglobin level or of myoglobinuria does not exclude the diagnosis as levels may return to normal within 1 to 6 hours after the onset of muscle necrosis.

Other laboratory studies are useful in identifying the common complications  of  rhabdomyolysis  and  the  underlying  cause.  Urinalysis should  be  obtained  for  all  patients.  Serum  electrolyte,  calcium,  phosphorus, and uric acid levels help detect hyperkalemia, abnormal calcium and phosphorus levels, and hyperuricemia. Serum creatinine and BUN levels are needed to identify acute renal failure. Because disseminated

SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

intravascular  coagulation  is  a  potential  complication,  a  baseline  CBC should  be  obtained  and  a  coagulopathic  screen  considered  (e.g.,  prothrombin  time,  partial  thromboplastin  time,  fibrin  split  products,  and fibrinogen level). Other common laboratory findings in rhabdomyolysis include elevated levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, creatine, and aminotransferases. Further laboratory testing should be guided by the medical history and clinical presentation.

Other  causes  of  muscle  pain  and  weakness  besides  rhabdomyolysis should  be  considered  in  the  appropriate  clinical  setting.  These  include acute  myopathies,  periodic  paralysis,  polymyositis  or  dermatomyositis, and  Guillain-Barré  syndrome.  Rhabdomyolysis  associated  with  strenuous exercise, fasting, or repeat episodes of rhabdomyolysis suggests an inherited metabolic myopathy.

# Emergencies in Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients

Jonathan A. Maisel

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may sustain multiple complications of their disease process and treatment. Emergent dialysis is most commonly required for hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, and pulmonary edema resistant to alternative therapy. See the appropriate chapters for discussion of the management of hypertension, heart failure, bleeding disorders, and electrolyte disorders.

# ■ CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS

Elevated  levels  of  troponin  I  and  T  are  common,  even  in  those  who  are asymptomatic, and are associated with increased long-term risk of ischemic heart disease. Myocardial infarction may be defined by a 20% or greater rise in  the  troponin  value,  with  at  least  one  value  above  the  99th  percentile. Hypertension occurs in most patients starting dialysis. Management includes control  of  blood  volume,  followed  by  use  of  adrenergic-blocking  drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilating agents. Congestive heart failure (CHF) may be caused by hypertension, coronary ischemia, and valvular disease, as well as uremic cardiomyopathy, fluid overload, and arteriovenous (A V) fistulas (high output failure). Treatment includes supplemental oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and possibly furosemide 60 to 100 mg IV, as its pulmonary vasodilator effect may provide relief, even in oliguric patients. Preload can be further reduced by inducing diarrhea with sorbitol and with phlebotomy (minimum 150 mL). Blood should be collected in a transfusion bag so that it may be transfused back to the patient during subsequent dialysis.  Hemodialysis  (HD)  is  the  definitive  treatment.  Pericarditis  in  ESRD patients  is  usually  due  to  worsening  uremia.  Electrocardiographic  (ECG) changes typical of acute pericarditis are not always seen. Pericardial friction rubs are louder than in most other forms of pericarditis, often palpable, and frequently  persist  after  the  metabolic  abnormalities  have  been  corrected. Uremic pericarditis is treated with intensive dialysis. Cardiac tamponade is the  most  serious  complication  of  uremic  pericarditis.  It  presents  with changes  in  mental  status,  hypotension,  or  dyspnea. An  enlarged  heart  on chest x-ray may suggest the diagnosis, which can be confirmed with echocardiography.  Hemodynamically  significant  pericardial  effusions  require pericardiocentesis under fluoroscopic or ultrasonographic guidance.

# ■ NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS

Uremic encephalopathy presents with altered mental status, cognitive defects, memory loss, slurred speech, and asterixis. The progressive neurologic symptoms of uremia are the most common indications for initiating HD. It should remain a diagnosis of exclusion until structural, vascular, infectious, toxic, and metabolic causes of neurologic dysfunction have been ruled out. Peripheral neuropathy, manifested by paresthesias, diminished deep tendon reflexes,

CHAPTER 52: Emergencies in Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients

297

impaired vibration sense, muscle wasting, and weakness, occurs in 60% to 100% of patients with ESRD. Autonomic dysfunction, characterized by postural  dizziness,  gastric  fullness,  bowel  dysfunction,  reduced  sweating, reduced heart rate variability, and baroreceptor control impairment, is common in ESRD patients. Stroke is seen in 6% of HD patients, with half of cases being hemorrhagic, typically subdural hematomas. Stroke may be caused by cerebrovascular disease, head trauma, bleeding dyscrasias, anticoagulation, excessive ultrafiltration, or hypertension. Stroke should be considered in any ESRD patient presenting with a change in mental status.

# ■ hEMATOLOGIC COMPLICATIONS

Anemia is caused by decreased erythropoietin, blood loss from dialysis, frequent phlebotomy, and decreased red cell survival. Factitious anemia reflects changes in plasma volume related to dialysis. Abnormal hemostasis in ESRD is multifactorial in origin, resulting in an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding, subcapsular liver hematomas, subdural hematomas, and intraocular bleeding. Benefit may be seen following the infusion of desmopressin 0.3 μ g/kg or cryoprecipitate . Immunologic compromise, caused by impaired leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis, leads to high mortality rates from infection. Dialysis does not appear to improve immune system function.

# ■ GASTROINTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS

Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting are common symptoms of uremia, and are used as an indication to initiate dialysis, and assess its efficacy. Chronic constipation  is  common,  due  to  decreased  fluid  intake  and  the  use  of phosphate-binding gels.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF hEMODIALYSIS

Hypotension is the most frequent complication of HD. Excessive ultrafiltration due to underestimation of the patient's ideal blood volume (dry weight) is the most  common  cause  of  intradialytic  hypotension.  Cardiac  compensation  for fluid  loss  may  be  compromised  by  diastolic  dysfunction  common  in  ESRD patients. Other causes of intradialytic hypotension include myocardial dysfunction  from ischemia, hypoxia, arrhythmias, and pericardial tamponade, abnormalities of vascular tone secondary to sepsis or antihypertensive medications, and volume loss from inadequate oral intake, vomiting, diarrhea, GI bleeding, or blood tubing or filter leaks. Treatment consists of Trendelenberg positioning, oral salt solution, or infusion of normal saline solution. If these interventions fail, excessive ultrafiltration is unlikely, and further evaluation will be required.

Dialysis disequilibrium, caused by cerebral edema following large solute clearances, is characterized by nausea, vomiting, and hypertension, which can progress to seizures, coma, and death. Treatment consists of terminating dialysis, and administering mannitol intravenously to increase serum osmolality.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF VASCULAR ACCESS

Complications of vascular access account for more inpatient hospital days than any other complication of HD. Thrombosis or stenosis present with loss of the bruit and thrill over the access. These need to be treated within

--- Page 318 ---

298

SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

24 hours with angiographic clot removal, angioplasty, or direct injection of thrombolytic into the access. Vascular access infections often present with signs  of  systemic  sepsis,  including  fever,  hypotension,  and  an  elevated white blood cell count. Classic signs of pain, erythema, swelling, and discharge are often missing. Obtain both peripheral and catheter blood cultures simultaneously. A fourfold higher colony count in the catheter culture suggests it is the source. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism, followed by gram-negative bacteria. Patients usually require hospitalization along with treatment with vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV and an aminoglycoside, such as gentamycin 100 mg IV. Potential life-threatening hemorrhage from a vascular access may result from a ruptured aneurysm or anastomosis, or overanticoagulation. Bleeding can often be controlled with 5 to 10 minutes of pressure at the puncture site. If this fails, the addition of an adsorbable gelatin sponge soaked in reconstituted thrombin , or a prothrombotic gauze, followed by 10 minutes of direct pressure may be effective.  Life-threatening hemorrhage may require placement of a tourniquet proximal to the access, and vascular surgery consultation. If the etiology is excessive anticoagulation, the effects of heparin can be reversed with protamine 0.01 mg per unit heparin dispensed during dialysis or 10 to 20 mg protamine if  the  heparin  dose  is  unknown.  If  a  newly  inserted  vascular access continues to bleed, desmopressin 0.3 μ g/kg IV can be given as an adjunct to direct pressure.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS

Peritonitis is the most common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in other patients with peritonitis,  and  include  fever,  abdominal  pain,  and  rebound  tenderness.  A cloudy effluent supports the diagnosis. Peritoneal fluid should be sent to the  laboratory  for  cell  count,  Gram  stain,  culture,  and  sensitivity.  With peritonitis, cell counts usually reveal > 100 leukocytes/mm 3 , with > 50% neutrophils. Gram stain is positive in only 10% to 40% of culture-proven peritonitis.  Organisms  isolated  include Staphylococcus  epidermidis,  S. aureus, Streptococcus species, and gram-negative bacteria. Empiric therapy begins with a few rapid exchanges of dialysate to decrease the number of  inflammatory  cells  within  the  peritoneum.  The  addition  of heparin (500 to 1000 U/L dialysate) decreases fibrin clot formation. Empiric antibiotics, covering gram-positive organisms (e.g., cephalothin or vancomycin 500 mg/L dialysate) and gram-negative organisms (e.g., gentamycin 100 mg/L dialysate), are added to the dialysate. Inpatient versus outpatient treatment of PD-related peritonitis should be based on clinical presentation.

Infections around the PD catheter are characterized by pain, erythema, swelling, and discharge. Causative organisms are S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Outpatient treatment consists of a first-generation cephalosporin or ciprofloxacin .

# ■ URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting. More than 50% of women experience one in their lifetimes, and approximately 12% of women have a UTI annually. UTIs are divided into two major categories: lower tract infections and upper tract infections. Lower UTIs include urethritis , typically caused by sexually transmitted diseases and differentiated by the presence of discharge, and cystitis , an acute bacterial infection of the urinary bladder. Pyelonephritis is an infection of the upper urinary tract structures including the ureters and kidneys. Differentiation of upper and lower UTIs is based on history and physical exam.

Uncomplicated UTI occurs in young, healthy, nonpregnant women with structurally and functionally normal urinary tracts.

Complicated UTI occurs in patients who are older, healthy, nonpregnant women with normal urinary tracts: that is, all men, and women who have a structural or functional genitourinary abnormality or an underlying predisposing medical condition that increases the risk of infection and recurrence or reduces the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is the presence of significant bacteria in  urine  without  signs  or  symptoms  that  are  referable  to  a  urinary  tract infection; the usual cutoff is a single organism isolated in a quantity of at least 100,000 colony forming U/mL. Screening and treatment is not generally recommended, with the exception of women who are pregnant or men who are going to undergo a transurethral prostate resection.

More than 80% of UTIs are caused by Escherichia coli. Other causative organisms include Klebsiella , Proteus , Enterobacter , Pseudomonas , Chlamydia , and Staphylococcus saprophyticus .

# Clinical Features

Typical  symptoms  of  cystitis  include  frequency,  urgency,  hesitancy,  and suprapubic pain.  Pyelonephritis  is  characterized  by  the  addition  of  flank pain  or  costovertebral  angle  tenderness,  particularly  in  conjunction  with fever,  chills,  or  nausea  and  vomiting.  If  vaginal  or  urethral  discharge  is present, urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis, or PID are more likely than UTI. As in many diseases, diabetics and the elderly have a predilection for presenting  atypically,  and  weakness,  malaise,  generalized  abdominal  pain,  or altered mental status may be the only signs or symptoms noted.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of UTI can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urine dipstick or urinalysis and culture. Clean-catch midstream collection of urine is as accurate as urine obtained by catheterization if the patient

299

--- Page 320 ---

300

SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

follows  instructions  carefully.  Catheterization  should  only  be  used  in  a patient  that  cannot  void  spontaneously,  is  too  ill  or  immobilized,  or  is extremely  obese.  Note  that  1%  to  2%  of  patients  develop  a  UTI  after  a single catheter insertion.

The two tests of interest on urine dipstick are nitrite reaction, a measure of bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase, a measure of pyuria. Nitrite has a very high specificity ( > 90%), but a low sensitivity (50%); several organisms  are  not  detected  by  this  test  ( Enterococcus , Pseudomonas ,  and Acinetobacter ).  Leukocyte esterase sensitivity (77%) is affected by high levels  of  protein  or  glucose  in  the  urine.  In  addition  it  may  be  falsely positive in vaginitis or cervicitis. If either nitrite or leukocyte esterase is positive, the sensitivity is 75% and specificity is 82%. If both are positive, the specificity is 98% to 100%. A positive urine dipstick nitrite or leukocyte test result supports the diagnosis of UTI; a negative test result does not exclude it.

Urinalysis also evaluates bacteriuria and pyuria, the urine white blood cell count. Bacteriuria is defined as any bacteria on a Gram-stained specimen of uncentrifuged urine, and has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of over 60%. False-negative results may occur in patients with low-colonycount UTI or Chlamydia infections. False-positive results can occur with vaginal  or  fecal  contamination.  Pyuria  is  defined  as  greater  than  2  to  5 white blood cells per high power field in women and 1 to 2 white blood cells  per  high  power  field  in  men.  False-negative  results  may  occur  in symptomatic  patients  with  dilute  urine,  incompletely  treated  UTI,  an obstructed, infected kidney, or systemic leukopenia.

Urine culture should only be performed for the following patients: those with  complicated  UTI  (including  men  and  pregnant  women),  those  with relapse or reinfection, children, and those who are septic. Finally, imaging (CT or ultrasound) should be limited to patients with severe or nonresponsive pyelonephritis, or if there is a significant concern for a renal stone.

No single test or combination of testing can effectively rule out UTI in women presenting to the ED with symptoms of cystitis, and if test results are equivocal, consider initiating empiric treatment.

The differential diagnosis for patients presenting with dysuria includes vaginitis and cervicitis in women and urethritis, prostatitis, and epididymitis in men. Intraabdominal pathology, bladder or urethral structural abnormalities or cancer, chemical irritation or allergies to hygienic products, and trauma are also considerations.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Appropriate antimicrobial treatment should rapidly improve symptoms in all  UTIs  and  also  minimize  growing  community  antibiotic  resistance. Consider using nitrofurantoin 100 mg extended release twice a day PO for 5 days as a first-line agent in uncomplicated UTI. Alternatives in uncomplicated UTI include TMP-SMX DS 160/800 mg twice a day for 3 days or fosfomycin 3 g in a single dose. Avoid flouroquinolones in uncomplicated UTI to reduce antibiotic resistance.

For complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day  for  7  days  is  considered  the  first-line  agent.  Alternatives  include levofloxacin 750 mg daily for 5 days or cefpodoxime 400 mg twice a day for  7  to  14  days.  If  local  resistance  is  less  than  20%, TMP-SMX DS

--- Page 321 ---

CHAPTER 53: Urinary Tract Infections and Hematuria

301

160/800  mg  twice  a  day  for  7  to  14  days  or amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice a day for 14 days are acceptable.

For pregnant patients, ABU should be treated with 3 days of nitrofurantoin and UTI should be treated with 7 days of nitrofurantoin . Fluoroquinolones  and  tetracyclines  are  teratogenic  and  should  be  avoided,  and TMP-SMX should be used with caution in the first and third trimesters.

If there is suspicion for concomitant infection with gonorrhea or Chlamydia , antibiotic choice is more complex (see Chapter 87, "Sexually Transmitted Infections").

In addition to the antibiotic, prescribe a 2-day course of a bladder analgesic  such  as phenazopyridine 200  mg  three  times  a  day.  Discharge instructions  must  include  return  precautions  for  uncontrolled  pain,  fever, vomiting, and also should encourage adequate hydration, completion of the entire  antibiotic  course,  and  outpatient  follow-up  with  a  primary  care doctor.

Admit  patients  with  pyelonephritis  who  exhibit  intractable  vomiting. Consider  admission  for  pregnant  females  (20%  will  develop  sepsis)  and patients with inadequate outpatient follow-up. Parenteral antibiotic options for  inpatient  management  of  pyelonephritis  include ceftriaxone 1  g  IV daily, ciprofloxacin 400  mg  IV  every  12  hours,  and piperacillin -tazobactam , 3.375 g IV every 6 hours.

# ■ hEMATURIA

Gross hematuria, visible to the eye, suggests a lower urinary tract source; however,  other  pigments  such  as  myoglobin  can  simulate  hematuria. Microscopic hematuria ( > 3 RBCs/HPF) suggests a renal source, though it can also be present in UTI.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A urine dipstick is positive with approximately 5 to 20 red blood cells per milliliter of urine. A positive dipstick should be followed by microscopy. Urethral  catheterization  induces  hematuria  in  15%  of  patients.  Falsepositives  may  also  result  from  myoglobin,  free  hemoglobin  due  to hemolysis, and porphyrins. False-negative results may occur if the urine has a high specific gravity.

Any  process  that  results  in  infection,  inflammation,  or  injury  to  the kidneys, ureters, bladder, prostate, male genitalia, or urethra may result in hematuria. UTI is the most common cause of hematuria associated with urgency, dysuria, and nocturia, whereas painless hematuria is largely due to neoplastic, hyperplastic, or vascular causes. The most common causes of hematuria  in  patients < 40  years  are  infections  and  inflammatory  conditions,  including  UTI,  prostatitis,  urethritis,  sexually  transmitted  diseases, epididymo-orchitis,  nephrolithiasis,  and  tuberculosis.  In  older  patients, consider renal and bladder cancer, as well as prostate tumors and benign prostatic hypertrophy in men. Consider strenuous exercise or poststreptococcal infection (in younger patients), as well as trauma, malignant hypertension, eroding abdominal aortic aneurysm, coagulopathy, foreign body, Henoch-Schonlein  purpura,  pulmonary-renal  syndromes,  sickle  cell disease complications, and renal vein thrombosis. Hematuria in a patient taking  oral  anticoagulants  should  not  be  attributed  to  the  anticoagulant

302 SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

alone,  as  the  incidence  of  underlying  disease  is  up  to  80%  in  patients referred to urology. Imaging in the ED for hematuria should be limited to patients  with  trauma,  symptoms  of  nephrolithiasis,  or  high  concern  for abdominal aortic aneurysm.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of hematuria is directed at the cause. ED management consists of the minimization of complications and appropriate referral or admission for further evaluation. All patients with hematuria should be promptly followed up by either primary care or urology.

Admit  patients  with  infection  associated  with  an  obstructive  stone, intractable  pain  or  vomiting,  hemodynamic  instability,  newly  diagnosed glomerulonephritis, significant anemia, renal insufficiency, bladder outlet obstruction, preeclampsia, or any other potentially life-threatening cause of hematuria.

# Acute Urinary Retention

Casey Glass

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Urinary retention can be either acute or chronic. The most common cause of retention is outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)  in  men,  although  medication  use,  acute  neurologic  dysfunction, urinary tract bleeding or calculi, and other anatomic obstruction are also common causes in both men and women. Acute syndromes typically present with rapid onset of lower abdominal pain occasionally radiating to the lower back. Patients typically complain of difficulty voiding but some may not volunteer this information. There is a 20% chance of a recurrence in the following 6 months after an episode of acute obstruction. Chronic obstruction usually presents with lower abdominal discomfort and the patient may note incomplete voiding or the need to void frequently. Overflow incontinence is often present.

The  history  should  address  previous  episodes  of  obstruction,  recent medication  changes,  and  over-the-counter  medicine  use.  Assess  for  any history of trauma or neurologic disability or symptoms of infection. It is critical  to  know if  any recent urologic procedures or urinary catheterizations have been performed. The duration of symptoms is also important as it is associated with the development of postobstructive diuresis and renal dysfunction.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Causes of urinary retention may include anatomic obstruction, neurologic dysfunction, medication side effect, trauma to the genitourinary tract, infection,  and  psychological stress. Fever may indicate infection as either the cause or as a result of urinary outlet obstruction. Tachycardia and hypotension may resolve after the obstruction is relieved. The physical examination should address the functional and anatomic assessment of the lower urinary tract.  Palpate  the  abdomen  for  a  suprapubic  mass  corresponding  to  the distended urinary bladder. The penis should be examined for stricture at the meatus or palpable abnormalities of the penile urethra. In men the prostate should be assessed for size, texture, and tenderness. The female lower urinary tract should be evaluated for bladder prolapse or stricture of the urethral meatus. A pelvic exam is generally indicated to screen for infection or mass as a cause of obstruction. A comprehensive neurologic examination should be performed in all patients and perineal sensation and anal sphincter tone should be documented.

Bedside ultrasound can be very helpful both in distinguishing the degree of obstruction and in discriminating obstruction from the sensation of fullness associated with bladder spasm in conditions such as inflammatory or infectious cystitis. The patient should first be encouraged to attempt to void. After a voiding attempt the bladder is imaged with a low-frequency sector

format probe in both the transverse and sagittal views (Figure 54-1). Many manufacturers have a calculation package available to estimate the retained urine volume. Residual volumes > 50 to 150 cc are consistent with urinary retention; however, volumes in the setting of retention are typically greater than 300 cc.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The goals of emergency department care are relieving the discomfort of retention, assessing for any secondary injury to the renal system, and treatment of the primary cause of retention.

# Male Genital Problems

Gavin R. Budhram

# ■ TESTICULAR TORSION

Testicular  torsion  results  from  abnormal  fixation  of  the  testis  within  the tunica  vaginalis,  allowing  the  testis  to  twist.  It  exhibits  a  bimodal  age distribution,  peaking  in  the  perinatal  period  and  during  puberty  but  may occur  at  any  age.  Although  sometimes  associated  with  trauma,  torsion usually occurs in the absence of any preceding event.

# Clinical Features

Because of the potential for infarction and infertility, testicular torsion must be the primary consideration in any male complaining of testicular pain. Pain usually occurs suddenly, is severe, and is felt in the lower abdominal quadrant,  the  inguinal  canal,  or  the  testis.  The  pain  may  be  constant  or intermittent but is not positional because torsion is primarily an ischemic event. Although symptom onset tends to occur after exertion, the testicle also may twist from unilateral cremasteric muscle contraction during sleep. Early in presentation, the affected testicle is firm, tender, elevated, and in a transverse lie compared to the contralateral testicle. The unilateral absence of the cremasteric reflex is a sensitive but nonspecific finding.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Color-flow  duplex  ultrasound  is  the  most  commonly  used  confirmatory study,  but  sensitivity  ranges  from  69%  to  90%.  In  addition,  urinalysis  is typically ordered, but pyuria does not rule out testicular torsion.

Torsion of the appendages is more common than testicular torsion but is not dangerous because the appendix testis and appendix epididymis have no known function. The diagnosis is supported by pain that is most intense near the head of the epididymis or testis, an isolated tender nodule, or the pathognomonic blue dot appearance of a cyanotic appendage with illumination through thin prepubertal scrotal skin. If normal intratesticular blood flow can be demonstrated with color Doppler, surgical exploration is not necessary  because  most  appendages  calcify  or  degenerate  over  10  to 14  days  and  cause  no  harm.  The  differential  for  testicular  torsion  also includes epididymitis, inguinal hernia, hydrocele, and scrotal hematoma.

medial  to  lateral  direction,  similar  to  the  opening  of  a  book.  The endpoint for successful detorsion is pain relief; urologic referral is still indicated.

# ■ EpIDIDYMITIS AND ORChITIS

# Clinical Features

Epididymitis is characterized by gradual onset of pain due to inflammation. Bacterial infection is the most common cause, with infecting agents dependent on the patient's age. In patients < 35 years, epididymitis is due primarily to sexually transmitted diseases; culture or DNA probe for gonococcus and Chlamydia is  indicated  in  males < 35  years  even  in  the  absence  of urethral  discharge.  Common  urinary  pathogens  such  as Escherichia  coli and Klebsiella predominate  in  older  men.  Epididymitis  causes  lower abdominal, inguinal canal, scrotal, or testicular pain alone or in combination. Due to the inflammatory nature of the pain, patients with epididymitis may note  transient  pain  relief  when  elevating  the  scrotal  contents  while recumbent (positive Prehn's sign).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Initially, when tenderness is well localized to the epididymis, the clinical diagnosis  is  clear.  However,  progression  of  inflammation  results  in  the physical examination finding of a single, large testicular mass (epididymoorchitis), which is difficult to differentiate from testicular torsion or carcinoma.  Testicular  malignancy  should  be  suspected  in  patients  presenting with asymptomatic testicular mass, firmness, or induration. Ten percent of tumors present with pain due to hemorrhage within the tumor. Orchitis in isolation  is  rare;  it  usually  occurs  in  conjunction  with  other  systemic infections, such as mumps or other viral illnesses.

# ■ ACUTE pROSTATITIS

Acute prostatitis is a bacterial inflammation of the prostate presenting with varying complaints of suprapubic or genital pain, back pain, perineal pain, voiding difficulties, frequency, dysuria, pain with ejaculation, and fever and chills.  Patients  at  risk  include  those  with  anatomic  or  neurophysiologic lower urinary tract obstruction, acute epididymitis or urethritis, unprotected rectal intercourse, phimosis, and an indwelling urethral catheter. The causative  organism  is E.  coli in  most  cases,  with Pseudomonas , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , Serratia , or Staphylococcus causing the remainder. Physical examination usually reveals perineal, rectal, and prostate tenderness. The diagnosis is clinical as urinalysis and culture are often negative even after prostate  massage.  Treatment  is ciprofloxacin 500  mg  twice  daily,  or levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily, or ofloxacin 300 mg PO twice daily. All treatments  should  be  for  2  to  4  weeks.  Pain  medicine  may  be  required. Admission is not necessary unless the patient is septic, immunocompromised, has significant comorbidities, or has worsened on outpatient therapy. In this case, IV treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 to 4.5 g or cefotaxime with an aminoglycoside may be initiated. Consider testing and treatment  for  gonorrhea  and  chlamydia  in  patients  with  risk  factors  for sexually transmitted disease.

# ■ SCROTUM

Scrotal  abscesses may  be  localized  to  the  scrotal  wall  or  may  arise  from extensions of infections of intrascrotal contents (i.e., testis, epididymis, and bulbous urethra). A simple hair follicle scrotal wall abscess can be managed by incision  and  drainage;  no  antibiotics  are  required  in  immunocompetent patients. When a scrotal abscess is suspected to arise from an intrascrotal infection, ultrasound may demonstrate pathology in the testis and/or epididymis. Retrograde urethrography may be needed to identify a source in the urethra. Definitive care of any complex abscess calls for a urology consultation.

Fournier gangrene is a polymicrobial infection of the perineal subcutaneous tissues. Diabetic males are at highest risk, but any immunocompromised state can be associated with the disease. Prompt diagnosis is essential to prevent extensive tissue loss. Early surgical consultation is recommended for  at-risk  patients  who  present  with  scrotal,  rectal,  or  genital  pain. Treatment  mainstays  include  aggressive  fluid  resuscitation  with  normal saline  solution  and  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  to  cover  gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms: imipenem 1 g IV every 8 hours or meropenem 500 mg to 1 g IV every 8 hours plus vancomycin 1 g IV every 12 hours if methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is suspected. Care usually includes hyperbaric oxygen therapy (if readily available) and surgical debridement.

# ■ pENIS

Balanoposthitis is inflammation of the glans (balanitis) and foreskin (posthitis).  Upon  foreskin  retraction,  the  glans  and  prepuce  appear  purulent, excoriated,  malodorous,  and  tender.  Treatment  consists  of  cleaning  with mild soap, ensuring adequate dryness, applying antifungal creams ( nystatin 100,000 U/g, four times daily or clotrimazole 1% cream bid), and using an

oral azole ( fluconazole 150 mg single dose, reevaluate at 7 days for repeat dosing). Urologic referral is needed for reassessment and possible circumcision in recurrent cases. An oral cephalosporin (e.g., cephalexin 500 mg, times daily) should be prescribed in cases of secondary bacterial infection. Balanoposthitis can be the sole presenting sign of diabetes.

Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin proximally (Fig. 55-1). Physiologic phimosis is common in boys but less than 10% of foreskins remain  nonretractile  at  age  3  with  nearly  all  resolving  by  adolescence. Pathologic phimosis occurs as a result of infection, poor hygiene, or previous  injury  with  scarring.  Hemostatic  dilation  of  the  preputial  ostium relieves urinary retention until definitive dorsal slit or circumcision can be performed. Topical steroid therapy, such as hydrocortisone 1% cream for 4  to  6  weeks,  along  with  daily  preputial  retraction,  reduces  the  rate  of required circumcision.

--- Page 330 ---

310 SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

Paraphimosis is the inability to reduce the proximal edematous foreskin distally over the glans (see Fig. 55-1). Paraphimosis is a true urologic emergency  because  the  resulting  glans  edema  and  venous  engorgement  can progress to arterial compromise and gangrene. If surrounding tissue edema can be successfully compressed, as by wrapping the glans with 2 × 2-in. elastic  bandages  for  5  minutes,  the  foreskin  may  be  reduced.  Making several puncture wounds with a small (22- to 25-gauge) needle may help with expression of glans edema fluid. Local anesthetic block of the penis is helpful  if  patients  cannot  tolerate  the  discomfort  associated  with  edema compression  and  removal.  If  arterial  compromise  is  suspected  or  has occurred, local infiltration of the constricting band with 1% plain lidocaine followed by superficial vertical incision of the band will decompress the glans and allow foreskin reduction.

Penile  entrapment injuries  occur  when  various  objects  are  wrapped around  the  penis  potentially  occluding  vascular  supply.  Objects  may  be removed by a variety of techniques including compression, cutting, cooling the penis, and possibly even urologic surgical removal. Retrograde urethrogram and Doppler studies may be employed if indicated to assess urethral injury and distal penile arterial blood supply, respectively.

Penile fracture occurs when there is an acute tear of the penile tunica albuginea. The penis is acutely swollen, discolored, and tender in a patient with history of intercourse-associated trauma accompanied by a snapping sound and sudden loss of erection. Retrograde urethrography may be indicated for assurance of urethral integrity. Urologic consultation is indicated.

Peyronie  disease produces  progressive  penile  deformity,  typically curvature with erections, that is painful and may result in erectile dysfunction  or  preclude  successful  vaginal  intercourse.  Examination  shows  a thickened plaque on the dorsal penile shaft. Assurance and urologic followup are indicated.

Priapism is  a  painful  pathologic erection that may be associated with urinary retention. Infection and impotence are other complications. Corporal aspiration and instillation of an α -adrenergic antagonist (i.e., phenylephrine)  is  the  next  step  and  may  need  to  be  performed  by  the  emergency physician  when  urologic  consultation  is  not  available.  Even  when  emergency physicians provide stabilizing care, urologic consultation is indicated in all cases.

# ■ UREThRA

Urethritis is  characterized  by  purulent  urethral  discharge.  Diagnosis  is clinical but is often confirmed with a first-void urine specimen. Causative agents  are  usually Chlamydia  trachomatis or Neisseria  gonorrhoeae , though Trichomonas , Ureaplasma urealyticum, and  herpes  simplex  virus may also occasionally cause urethritis. Treatment is ceftriaxone 250  mg IM and azithromycin 1 g PO.

Urethral stricture is becoming more common due to the high incidence of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  may  result  in  urinary  retention.  A normal post-void residual volume should be less than 100 mL and can be estimated  with  bedside  ultrasonography.  If  a  patient's  bladder  cannot  be cannulated, the differential diagnosis includes urethral stricture, voluntary external  sphincter  spasm,  bladder-neck  contracture,  or  benign  prostatic

--- Page 331 ---

CHAPTER 55: Male Genital Problems

311

hypertrophy. If a 14- or 16-Fr Foley cannot be passed, a Coudé catheter may  be  used  to  navigate  a  stricture.  Retrograde  urethrography  can  be performed to delineate the location and extent of a urethral stricture. Endoscopy is necessary to confirm bladder neck contracture or define the extent of  an  obstructing  prostate  gland.  Suspected  voluntary  external  sphincter spasm can be overcome by holding the patient's penis upright and encouraging him to relax the perineum and breathe slowly during the procedure. After no more than three gentle attempts to pass a 12-Fr Coudé catheter into a urethra prepared with anesthetic lubricant, urologic consultation should be  obtained.  In  an  emergency  situation,  suprapubic  cystotomy  can  be performed using the Seldinger technique. Urologic follow-up should occur within 48 hours.

Urethral  foreign  bodies are  associated  with  bloody  urine  and  slow, painful  urination.  Radiography  of  the  bladder  and  urethral  areas  may disclose a foreign body. Removal of the foreign body often requires urologic  consultation  for  endoscopy  or  open  cystotomy,  though  a  gentle milking  action  of  the  proximal  end  of  a  urethral  foreign  body  may  be attempted.  Retrograde  urethrography  or  endoscopy  is  often  required  to confirm an intact urethra.

# Urologic Stone Disease

Geetika Gupta

The acute phenomenon of renal stones migrating down the ureter is referred to as renal colic. Adults and children can develop kidney stones. In adults, the  condition  is  more  common  in  males  than  in  females;  kidney  stones usually occur in the third to fifth decade of life. There is a reoccurrence rate of 37% within the first year of having a stone. Children under the age of 16 years constitute 7% of cases seen, with the distribution being equal between the sexes.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Patients usually present with an acute onset of severe pain, which may be associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. Patients are frequently anxious, pacing, or writhing and are unable to hold still or converse. The pain is sharp and episodic in nature due to the intermittent obstruction of the ureter and is relieved after the stone passes. The pain typically originates in either flank with subsequent radiation around the abdomen toward the groin. However, as the stone passes into the distal ureter, where 75% of stones are diagnosed, the pain may be located in the anterior abdominal or suprapubic area. Vesicular stones may present with intermittent dysuria and terminal hematuria. Children may present in a similar fashion, but up to 30% have only painless hematuria. Vital signs may demonstrate tachycardia and an elevated blood pressure, which are secondary to pain. Fever may be  present  if  there  is  a  concomitant  urinary  tract  infection.  Examination may show costovertebral tenderness or abdominal tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Hematuria may be present in 85% of patients with renal colic.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The consideration of urologic stones and renal colic is based on clinical judgment. The differential diagnosis includes abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Other concerning possibilities include appendicitis, mesenteric  ischemia,  cholecystitis,  ectopic  pregnancy,  gonadal  torsion, renal infarction, incarcerated hernia, epididymitis, salpingitis, pyelonephritis,  herpes  zoster,  drug-seeking  behavior,  musculoskeletal  strain,  and papillary necrosis. Papillary necrosis may be present in patients with sickle cell  disease,  diabetes,  nonsteroidal analgesic abuse, or infection. Patients receiving outpatient extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for urolithiasis may present to the emergency department (ED) with renal colic because the resulting 'sludge' is passed in the urine.

Obtain a urinalysis to assess for hematuria and infection. Check serum renal function, as a majority of patients who are stone formers have decreased creatinine clearance. Get a pregnancy test in females of childbearing age.

The  recommendation  for  the  ideal  modality  of  imaging  is  evolving. Imaging helps diagnose a ureteral stone, rules out other diagnoses, identifies complications, establishes the location of the stone, and/or assists with

312

CHAPTER 56: Urologic Stone Disease

313

the management if the stone fails to pass spontaneously. Noncontrast helical computed tomography (CT) has the overall highest sensitivity and specificity.  Positive  findings  include  changes  in  the  ureteral  caliber,  suspicious calcifications,  stranding  of  perinephric  fat,  and  dilation  of  the  collecting system. It has a PPV of 96% and a NPV of 93% to 97%. It can be performed quickly and can rule in or rule out other diagnoses. The disadvantage of CT is  radiation  exposure;  therefore,  many  facilities  have  adopted  a  low-dose CT protocol.  It  has  similar  sensitivities  as  regular  dose  radiation  CT  for stones > 3 mm and individuals with a BMI > 30 (Table 56-1).

The use of plain kidney-ureter-bladder film (KUB) is limited as only 90% of ureteral stones are radiopaque. A KUB cannot rule in or rule out a ureteral stone. The KUB is useful in following the progression of a stone, once visualized on CT, in the outpatient setting.

The IV pyelogram (IVP) is rarely used anymore in the ED. It provides information on renal function and anatomy and is used as an adjunct to CT.

Ultrasound (US), an anatomic rather than a functional test, is useful in patients for whom CT is not advised such as pregnant women and children. It detects hydronephrosis and larger stones but is not sensitive for midureteral  or  small,  less  than  5-mm  stones.  Sensitivity  increases  to  90%  for stones > 6 mm. A false-positive diagnosis of hydronephrosis may be related to a full bladder, renal cysts, and anatomic variation. A rapid bolus of crystalloid can result in a false-positive diagnosis of hydroureter. Bedside US by ED physicians may also decrease length of stay for selected patients.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

# Medications

Patients with a more complicated clinical situation should be admitted. Intravenous antibiotic selections to consider include gentamicin or tobramycin 1 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and ampicillin 1 to 2 g every 4 hours; piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375  g  every  6  hours; cefepime 2  g  every 8 hours; ticarcillin-clavulanic acid 3.1 g every 6 hours, or ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours.

# Disposition

If the stone is passed in the ED, no treatment is necessary other than elective  urologic  follow-up.  Patients  with  small  unilateral  stones  less  than 5  mm,  no  complicated  infection,  and  pain  controlled  by  oral  analgesics may be discharged with a urine strainer, prescriptions for oral analgesics and  medical  expulsive  therapy,  and  urologic  or  primary  care  physician follow-up within 7 days. The rate of stone passage depends on its size and location. A stone measuring 5-6 mm in diameter takes 7 to 30 days to pass. Instruct  patients  to  return  if  they  develop  fever,  persistent  vomiting,  or uncontrolled pain.

Urologic consultation on an emergent basis is needed in patients with a complete obstruction complicated by fever and/or urosepsis and in patients with a solitary or transplanted kidney. Discuss disposition with a urologist in  patients  with  a  stone  larger  than  5  mm,  renal  insufficiency,  severe underlying disease, extravasation or complete obstruction, sloughed renal papillae, UTI, or failed outpatient management.

Hospitalization  is  indicated  for  patients  who  have  a  solitary  or transplanted kidney with obstruction, uncontrolled severe pain, intractable emesis,  acute  renal  failure,  hypercalcemic  crisis,  severe  medical  comorbidities,  and  urosepsis.  Consider  admission  for  patients  with  a  fever, solitary or transplanted kidney without obstruction, obstructing stone with infection, urinary extravasation, significant medical comorbitidies, or large proximal ureteral stone.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF URINARY CATHETERS

Complications related to the use of urinary catheters are not infrequent and therefore the catheters should be used only when absolutely necessary. Silicone catheters are available for patients with latex allergies.

# Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection

Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTIs) are a very common cause of nosocomial infections. Signs and symptoms of CA-UTI include fever, rigors, altered mental status, malaise, or lethargy, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, acute hematuria, and pelvic discomfort. In those whose catheters have been removed, dysuria, urgent or frequent urination, or  suprapubic  pain  or  tenderness  may  indicate  CA-UTI.  Do  not  treat asymptomatic  bacteriuria  in  a  patient  with  a  short-term  catheterization, except  in  pregnancy  or  immediately  posturologic  procedure.  CA-UTI  in spinal cord injury patients may also present with increased spasticity, autonomic  dysreflexia,  and  a  sense  of  unease.  Pyelonephritis  is  the  most common  complication  of  CA-UTI  and  should  be  suspected  when  fever is  present.  Other  related  infections  include  prostatitis,  epididymitis,  and scrotal abscess.

Diagnosis of CA-UTI in the ED is made clinically with urine microscopy. Send urine for culture. Add blood cultures if the patient is septic or immunocompromised. An  ultrasound  may  be  useful  to  identify  urinary obstruction. Remember that pyuria is universal for patients with long-term ( > 1 month) indwelling catheters and in the absence of symptoms, pyuria should  not  be  used  in  the  diagnosis  of  infection.  Hematuria  is  a  better indicator  of  infection.  Remove  the  urinary  catheter  if  clinically  feasible  or replace  the  catheter  if  it  is > 7  days  old.  In  patients  with  mild  symptoms, empirically treat with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day, levofloxacin 500 mg once a day, or cefpodoxime 200 mg twice a day. Tailor specific antibiotic choice  to  local  bacterial  sensitivities.  Seven  days  is  the  recommended duration of antimicrobial treatment for patients with CA-UTI who have prompt  resolution  of  symptoms,  and  10  to  14  days  of  treatment  is recommended for those with a delayed response. In patients with catheterassociated pyelonephritis, admission is frequently required. Check urine cultures and blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis.

# Nondeflation of Foley Retention Balloon

Nondeflation  of  the  Foley  retention  balloon  prevents  the  removal  of  the catheter. Cut the plastic catheter valve just proximal to the inflation port and insert a flexible guide wire to expand the channel and deflate the balloon. If this is not successful, insert a 22-G central venous catheter (CVC) over the guide wire. Once the tip of the catheter enters the balloon, remove the

316

CHAPTER 57: Complications of Urologic Procedures and Devices

317

guide wire and deflate the balloon. If the inflated balloon persists, instill 10cc of mineral oil through the CVC and wait 15 minutes to dissolve the balloon (this step may be repeated). If these methods fail, consult a urologist to remove the catheter.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROSTOMY

Percutaneous nephrostomy is a urinary drainage procedure used for supravesical  or  ureteral  obstruction.  Bleeding  may  occur.  Check  hemoglobin, hematocrit, and renal function studies. Check platelet count and coagulation studies if a coagulopathy is suspected. Treat mild bleeding by irrigating the nephrostomy tube to clear the blood clots. If bleeding fails to resolve, a vascular injury may be present and emergent urology consult is indicated. Initiate fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion in severe cases.

Infectious  complications  from  nephrostomy  tubes  include  bacteriuria, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and urosepsis. Culture the urine and wound drainage (if any) and administer antibiotics after consulting a urologist.

Catheter dislodgment, tube blockage, and residual stone fragments can occur.  Obtain  a  CT  scan  and  consult  urology  to  treat  these  mechanical issues.

# ■ LITHOTRIPSY

Common post-lithotripsy complications include abdominal and flank pain, gross hematuria, skin ecchymosis, and ureteral obstruction from stone fragments. However, ruptured or perforated organs, infections (pyelonephritis, urosepsis, psoas abscess), vascular injury, and pancreatitis may also occur. The presence of hypotension, syncope, flank hematoma, drop in hemoglobin, and severe pain are all harbingers of serious complications (e.g., perinephric  and  renal  hematomas).  Administer  supportive  therapy  with IV fluids, antiemetics, and analgesics. Check blood counts, creatinine, and urinalysis. Obtain cultures and administer antibiotics if indicated. If simple obstruction is suspected, obtain a renal ultrasound. Obtain a CT scan if a more severe injury is suspected. Consult urology early in the process as surgical intervention may be indicated in these cases.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF URETERAL STENTS

A range of infectious complications can occur from ureteral stents. Therefore, order a urinalysis and culture for urinary symptoms, incontinence, flank pain, or change in the baseline discomfort. Treat simple infections with  outpatient  antibiotics  in  consultation  with  a  urologist,  as  stent removal is not always necessary. However, if pyelonephritis or urosepsis is suspected, obtain appropriate cultures, administer IV antibiotics, order imaging (abdominal series, ultrasound, and CT) to verify stent placement, and consult urology.

Late complications with long-term stent placement may be seen. Newonset abdominal pain, severe flank pain, fever, irritative bladder symptoms, or  gross  hematuria  may  be  indicative  of  stent  migration,  obstruction,  or infection. Obtain a urinalysis to evaluate for infection, imaging to evaluate stent  position,  and  urologic  consultation.  However,  new  anemia  without

--- Page 338 ---

318 SECTION 7: Renal and Genitourinary Disorders

hematuria  may  be  indicative  of  a  retroperitoneal  hematoma  and  is  diagnosed with CT. Assume vascular fistulization from an eroding stent in the presence of severe gross hematuria, syncope, or hypotension. Resuscitate these patients, order lab studies, irrigate the bladder, and transfuse appropriately. Obtain urology consultation immediately.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL URINARY SPHINCTERS

The artificial  sphincter  is  a  device  used  for  urinary  incontinence  from various causes. Skin flora cause early infections, while later infections are usually due to gram-negative pathogens. Never introduce a urinary drainage  catheter  through  an  artificial  urinary  sphincter .  Obtain urinalysis,  appropriate  labs,  cultures,  and  imaging,  and  administer IV antibiotics as indicated. Consult a urologist for further evaluation and management.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DEVICES

Injections for erectile dysfunction can result in priapism, which requires emergent  urologic  consultation.  The  most  common  complication  of vacuum devices is pain from improper use, but skin necrosis and infections can occur. Infection of implanted penile prostheses (both early and late), erosion of the prosthesis into the penile tissue, and prosthesis migration can occur. Administer broad-spectrum IV antibiotics if infection is present and consult a urologist for device removal.

# Vaginal Bleeding and Pelvic Pain in the Nonpregnant Patient

Joelle Borhart

# ■ VAGINAL BLEEDING

Abnormal vaginal bleeding is a common complaint in females presenting to  the  ED.  Determination of pregnancy status in patients of reproductive age  is  critical  to  formulate  the  appropriate  differential  diagnosis  and  to guide subsequent testing and decision making.

# Clinical Features

All patients should be asked about the amount and duration of bleeding. Reproductive and sexual history, history of sexually transmitted infections, trauma, medications, and the possibility of foreign bodies should be elicited.  Symptoms of a possible bleeding disorder (history of bruising, epistaxis, other abnormal bleeding), endocrine disorder, or liver disease should be noted. A complete abdominal and pelvic examination, including speculum and bimanual exam, should be performed on nonvirginal patients to look  for  structural  or  traumatic  causes  of  bleeding.  Skin  or  conjunctiva pallor, abnormal vital signs, or a report of dizziness, syncope, or weakness can indicate significant blood loss.

# Diagnosis and Differential

In prepubertal girls, causes of vaginal bleeding include genital trauma and/ or  sexual  abuse,  vaginitis,  tumors,  and  foreign  bodies.  Bleeding  coupled with vaginal discharge raises concerns for retained foreign bodies. Up to 20% of adolescents with abnormal uterine bleeding may have a primary coagulation disorder such as von Willebrand disease. Anovulatory cycles are also common during the teenage years. In women of reproductive age and perimenopausal women, bleeding can arise from the uterus or cervix and is most commonly due to anovulation, pregnancy, exogenous hormone use,  coagulopathy, uterine leiomyomas, cervical and endometrial polyps, pelvic infections, and thyroid dysfunction. In postmenopausal women, the most common causes of vaginal bleeding are exogenous estrogens, atrophic vaginitis, endometrial lesions including cancer, and other tumors.

319

--- Page 340 ---

320

SECTION 8: Gynecology and Obstetrics

The new term abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) encompasses all causes of abnormal bleeding in nonpregnant women and divides etiologies of AUB into structural and nonstructural causes. The use of the term dysfunctional uterine  bleeding is  no  longer  recommended. AUB  may  be  ovulatory  or anovulatory. Anovulatory cycles are common at the extremes of reproductive  age.  Patients  with  anovulatory  cycles  may  present  with  prolonged menses, irregular cycles, or intermenstrual bleeding. Usually the bleeding is painless and minimal, but severe bleeding can occur, resulting in anemia and iron depletion.

A pregnancy test must be obtained on all women of reproductive age to rule out pregnancy as a cause of bleeding. Other laboratory evaluation is guided by the history and physical examination. A CBC should be checked if  signs  of  excessive  bleeding  or  anemia  are  present. A  prolonged  PT  or elevated INR may identify a coagulopathy. Obtain thyroid function tests in patients with symptoms and signs of thyroid dysfunction. Ultrasonography is an important imaging modality to determine uterine size, characteristics of the endometrium, and to detect structural abnormalities. Ultrasound may be deferred for outpatient evaluation in stable, nonpregnant patients as the results will rarely change ED management.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most patients with vaginal bleeding are hemodynamically stable and need no acute intervention. Patients who are unstable with persistent bleeding require aggressive resuscitation: IV crystalloids, blood products, and gynecologic consultation for urgent D and C.

--- Page 341 ---

CHAPTER 58: Vaginal Bleeding and Pelvic Pain in the Nonpregnant Patient 321

# ■ pELVIC pAIN

Pelvic pain generally arises from gynecologic pathology but referred pain from extrapelvic conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract  infections  or  stones,  diverticulitis,  leaking  abdominal  aneurysm,  or appendicitis, need to be considered. Pregnancy should be excluded in all women  of  reproductive  age.  Pelvic  inflammatory  disease  is  a  common cause of pelvic pain and is discussed in Chapter 64.

# Clinical Features

Pelvic pain may be acute or chronic, intermittent or continuous. Attention to the characteristics of the pain will aid in determining etiologies. Sudden onset of unilateral pain suggests an ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, obstruction,  or  renal  lithiasis.  Gradual  onset  suggests  an  infectious  process  or slowly enlarging mass. Other attributes, such as the relationship of the pain with the menstrual cycle, aggravating and relieving factors, and associated urinary,  GI,  and  systemic  symptoms  assist  in  developing  the  differential diagnosis.

A complete abdominal and pelvic examination, including speculum and bimanual exams should be performed. A pregnancy test should be done to rule out pregnancy in women of reproductive age. Other testings, such as urinalysis,  CBC,  and  ultrasound,  are  guided  by  the  history  and  physical examination.

# Diagnosis and Differential

# Ovarian Cysts

Symptomatic  ovarian  cysts  typically  cause  sudden-onset  unilateral  pain. Cysts  can  be  complicated  by  bleeding  from  the  cyst  wall  (hemorrhagic cyst) or by cyst rupture. A ruptured cyst can causes abnormal vital signs and an acute abdomen. Cysts that are > 8 cm, multiloculated, or solid are concerning  for  malignancy,  dermoid  cysts,  or  endometriomas  ('chocolate cysts'). In women who are postmenopausal, an ovarian mass is malignant until proven otherwise. All patients with cysts should follow-up with their gynecologic provider for further evaluation.

# Ovarian Torsion

Ovarian  torsion  results  in  the  sudden  onset  of  severe  adnexal  pain  from ischemia of the ovary. Torsion is a surgical emergency and rapid intervention is necessary to preserve ovarian function. A history of acute onset of severe unilateral pain may be obtained, though atypical presentations are common. Pain may develop after exertion. Risk factors for torsion include pregnancy  (enlarged  corpus  luteum),  large  ovarian  cysts  or  tumors,  and chemical  induction  of  ovulation  (ovarian  hyperstimulation  syndrome). Ultrasound  with  Doppler  flow  imaging  is  the  diagnostic  procedure  of choice but is not 100% sensitive. Imaging early in the process may show congestion from venous outflow obstruction with preserved arterial flow and  images  obtained  during  a  transient  period  of  detorsion  may  appear normal. Analgesia, gynecologic consultation, and preparation for surgery are warranted if the diagnosis is suspected.

--- Page 342 ---

322 SECTION 8: Gynecology and Obstetrics

# Endometriosis

Endometriosis results from endometrium-like tissue implanted outside of the uterus causing chronic inflammation. Symptoms include recurrent pelvic pain associated with menstrual cycles, dyspareunia, and infertility. The definitive diagnosis is usually not made in the ED. Treatment consists of analgesics and gynecologic referral.

# Leiomyomas

Leiomyomas  (uterine  fibroids)  are  benign  smooth  muscle  tumors,  often multiple, seen most commonly in women in middle and later reproductive years. About 30% of women with leiomyomas will develop symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, bloating, backache, urinary symptoms, and dyspareunia. Severe pain can result with torsion of a pedunculated fibroid, or ischemia and infarction of a fibroid. Bimanual examination  may demonstrate a mass or an enlarged uterus. Pelvic ultrasound is confirmatory. Treatment consists of NSAIDs or other analgesics for pain, hormonal manipulation for excessive bleeding, and referral to a gynecologist for definitive therapy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most patients are ultimately discharged from the ED even though there may not  be  a  specific  diagnosis.  It  is  common  and  appropriate  to  discharge patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  undifferentiated  abdominal  pain.  Patients should receive detailed discharge instructions with strict return precautions outlined. Follow-up instructions should also be very specific. Reevaluation in 12 to 24 hours can be scheduled if any concern persists. Analgesics, such as NSAIDs ,  provide effective pain control for most outpatients, although some  patients  will  require  opioids,  such  as oxycodone/acetaminophen (5/325) one to two tablets every 4 to 6 hours PO for a few days.

# ■ ECTOPIC PREGNANCY

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester. Major risk factors include history of pelvic inflammatory disease, surgical procedures on the fallopian tubes including tubal ligation, previous EP, diethylstilbestrol exposure, intrauterine device use, and assisted reproduction techniques. The most common extrauterine location is the fallopian tube. This diagnosis must be considered in every woman of childbearing age presenting with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding.

# Clinical Features

The classic triad of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and amenorrhea used to describe EP may be present, but many cases occur with more subtle findings. Presenting signs and symptoms may be different in ruptured versus nonruptured EP. Location of the EP will also determine the clinical features.  The  vast  majority  of  EPs  implant  in  the  ampullary  portion  of  the fallopian  tube  but  additional  implantation  locations  include  the  cervix, abdomen, and cesarean scar. Ninety percent of women with EP complain of  abdominal pain;  50% to 80% have vaginal bleeding; and 70% give a history  of  amenorrhea.  The  pain  described  may  be  sudden,  lateralized, extreme, or relatively minor and diffuse. The presence of hemoperitoneum with diaphragmatic irritation may cause the pain to be referred to the shoulder or upper abdomen. Presenting vital signs may be entirely normal even with a ruptured EP. There is poor correlation with the volume of hemoperitoneum and vital signs in EP. Relative bradycardia, as a consequence of vagal stimulation, may be present even in cases with rupture and hemoperitoneum. Physical examination findings are highly variable. The abdominal examination  may  show  signs  of  localizing  or  diffuse  tenderness  with  or without peritoneal signs. The pelvic examination findings may be normal but more often show cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness with or without a mass, and possibly an enlarged uterus. Vaginal bleeding, ranging from spotting to heavy, is often present. Fetal heart tones may be heard in cases of EP beyond 12 weeks of gestation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  definitive  diagnosis  of  EP  is  made  either  by  ultrasound  (US)  or  by direct visualization during surgery. The diagnosis of pregnancy is central to the diagnosis of possible EP and needs to be confirmed first. Urine pregnancy testing (for urinary β -human chorionic gonadotropin [ β -hCG]) is a qualitative screening test with a threshold for detection of > 20 mIU/mL of β -hCG. Urine qualitative testing is 95% to 100% sensitive and specific as

323

324

SECTION 8: Gynecology and Obstetrics

compared with serum testing. Dilute urine, particularly when β -hCG levels are < 50 mIU/mL, may result in a false-negative result. Quantitative serum testing for the diagnosis of pregnancy is virtually 100% sensitive for detecting β -hCG levels > 5 mIU/mL and should be performed when the diagnosis of EP is considered but urine results are negative.

The primary goal of US in suspected EP is to determine if an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is present, since US cannot rule out the presence of EP. The transabdominal examination is usually performed first due to its wider field  of  view;  the  transvaginal  examination  is  performed  if  the  transabdominal examination is not diagnostic. When US reveals an unequivocal IUP  and  no  other  abnormalities,  EP  is  effectively  excluded  unless  the patient is at high risk for heterotopic pregnancy. Actual visualization of an EP  with  US  occurs  in  a  minority  of  cases.  Sonographic  findings  of  an empty  uterus  without  an  adnexal  mass  or  free  fluid  in  a  woman  with  a positive pregnancy test result are considered indeterminate. In such situations, the findings must be evaluated in context with the patient's quantitative β -hCG level. A high β -hCG level ( > 6000 mIU/mL for transabdominal US or > 1500 mIU/mL for transvaginal US) with an empty uterus is suggestive of EP. If the β -hCG is low ( < 1500 mIU/mL transvaginal), then the pregnancy may indeed be intrauterine or ectopic but often too small to be visualized on US or the patient may have already had a miscarriage. In this situation, repeat quantitative β -hCG testing in 2 days must be performed. β -hCG should increase at least 66% in that period; EP has a slower rate of increase. Since many EPs will have β -hCG levels < 1500 mIU/mL, quantitative β -hCG  levels  should  not  be  used  to  determine  the  need  for  US imaging.

Differential  diagnosis  in  the  patient  presenting  with  abdominal  pain, vaginal bleeding, and early pregnancy includes threatened, incomplete, or missed  abortion,  recent  elective  abortion,  implantation  bleeding,  molar pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, or corpus luteum cyst.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment  of  patients  with  suspected  EP  depends  on  the  patient's  vital signs,  physical  signs,  and  symptoms.  Close  communication  with  the obstetric-gynecologic consultant is essential.

# ■ ThREATENED ABORTION AND ABORTION

According to  the World  Health  Organization,  between  20%  and  40%  of pregnancies will spontaneously abort. Approximately 75% of these spontaneous abortions will occur before 8 weeks of gestation.

# Clinical Features

Vaginal bleeding in the first 20 weeks, with a closed cervical os, benign examination, and no passage of tissue, is termed threatened  abortion. A dilated  cervix  increases  the  likelihood  of  abortion  ( inevitable  abortion ). Incomplete abortion is  defined as partial passage of the conceptus and is more likely between 6 and 14 weeks of pregnancy. The patient may report passage of grayish white products of conception (POC), or the POC may be evident on pelvic examination. Complete abortion is  passage  of  all  fetal tissue  before  20  weeks  gestation. All  recovered  POC  should  be  sent  for pathologic  examination. Missed  abortion is  fetal  death  at  less  than  20 weeks  without  passage  of  any  fetal  tissue  for  4  weeks  after  fetal  death. Septic abortion implies evidence of infection during any stage of abortion, with signs and symptoms of pelvic pain, fever, cervical motion or uterine tenderness, or purulent or foul-smelling drainage.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Perform a pelvic examination and obtain a complete blood count (CBC), blood typing (and cross-matching for unstable patients) and rhesus (Rh) factor  determination,  urine  pregnancy  test,  quantitative β -hCG, and urinalysis. The differential diagnosis includes EP, implantation bleeding, and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Implantation bleeding, which is usually scant and painless, is a diagnosis of exclusion. GTD is a proliferative disease of the trophoblast that includes complete hydatidiform mole, partial  mole,  trophoblastic  tumor,  and  choriocarcinoma.  Patients  with GTD present with bleeding, an enlarged uterus out of proportion to menstrual  age,  and  a  significantly  elevated β -hCG  level. Also  consider  the possibility of a molar pregnancy in patients with hyperemesis gravidarum or pregnancy-induced hypertension before 24 weeks of gestation.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment  of  patients  with  suspected  threatened  abortion  and  abortion depends on the patient's vital signs, physical signs, and symptoms. Close communication with the obstetric-gynecologic consultant is essential.

# ■ NAUSEA AND VOMITING OF PREGNANCY

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally are seen in the first 12 weeks and affect  60%  to  80%  of  pregnant  women.  Cases  can  range  from  mild symptoms to hyperemesis gravidarum.

# Clinical Features

Findings on physical examination are usually normal except for signs of volume depletion. The presence of abdominal pain in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum is highly unusual and should suggest another diagnosis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnostic workup may include CBC, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinalysis. Differential diagnosis includes ruptured EP, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, hepatitis,  peptic  ulcer  disease,  pyelonephritis,  fatty  liver  of  pregnancy,  and hemolysis with elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (known as HELLP syndrome).

# Comorbid Diseases in Pregnancy

Abigail D. Hankin

Many medical conditions can present in the context of pregnancy, either as  a  preexisting  condition  or  arising  during  pregnancy.  This  chapter focuses on conditions that require different management when encountered in the pregnant patient. Some disorders are covered in other chapters within  this  text,  including  hypertension  (Chapters  26  and  61),  HIV infection (Chapter 92), and cardiac rhythm disturbances (Chapter 2).

# ■ DIABETES

Diabetics are at increased risk for complications of pregnancy and acute complications of diabetes. Many patients with gestational diabetes are managed with diet alone, though some patients require oral hypoglycemics such as metformin or glyburide. Insulin therapy is necessary for some patients with gestational diabetes and nearly all patients with type I or II diabetes. Insulin requirements increase as a pregnancy progresses, from 0.7 U/kg/d during the first trimester to 1.0 U/kg/d at term.

Pregnant patients are at increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and DKA can occur more rapidly, and at lower glucose levels, than in nonpregnant  patients.  DKA  should  be  considered  for  any  pregnant  diabetic patient who is ill appearing and/or has a blood glucose level ≥ 180 mg/dL. Treatment  of  DKA  includes  supplemental  oxygen,  left  lateral  decubitus positioning, and usual DKA care: isotonic fluid resuscitation to correct volume deficits, administration of continuous insulin, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and treatment of the underlying cause (see Chapter 129).

Mild hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL and able to follow commands) is treated with a snack of milk and crackers. Severe hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL and unable to follow commands) should be treated with 50 mL of 50% dextrose in water IV ,  with  1  to  2  mg  of glucagon given IM or subcutaneous if IV access is delayed. Subsequently, the patient should be given 5% dextrose solution IV at 50 to 100 mL/h.

# ■ HYPERTHYROIDISM

Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy increases the risk of preeclampsia, congenital anomalies, and neonatal morbidity. Clinical features may be subtle and may mimic normal pregnancy. Treatment is with propylthiouracil (PTU). Patients on PTU are at risk for purpuric rash and agranulocytosis.

Thyroid storm presents with fever, volume depletion, or cardiac decompensation manifesting as high-output heart failure. Management is similar to nonpregnant patients (see Table 60-1).

# ■ HYPERTENSION

Treatment is often considered for chronic hypertension, defined as blood pressure > 140/90  mm  Hg  measured  on  two  occasions  before  20  weeks gestation or sustained beyond 12 weeks gestation. Chronic hypertension is

typically treated with labetalol , nifedipine ,  or methyldopa while angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are avoided in pregnancy.

Acute  hypertensive  crisis  in  pregnancy  is  treated  with  labetalol  or hydralazine (see Table 60-2).

While blood pressure is being managed, fetal well-being should be closely monitored, and clinicians should consider superimposed preeclampsia.

# ■ DYSRHYTHMIAS

Dysrhythmias may be precipitated by pregnancy and labor/delivery. Supraventricular  tachycardias  are  treated  with  vagal  maneuvers, β -blockers, adenosine, verapamil, and diltiazem at usual dosages. Patients with atrial fibrillation  who  require  anticoagulation  should  be  managed  with  unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Electrical cardioversion may be used to treat dysrhythmias when indicated and have not been shown to be harmful to the fetus. Amiodarone should only be used to treat resistant, life-threatening dysrhythmias, as its use has been linked to fetal neurotoxicity.

* Risk of fetal bradycardia and neonatal thrombocytopenia.

# ■ THROMBOEMBOLISM

Deep  venous  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary  embolism  (PE)  are  the most common causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations.  Factors  associated  with  increased  risk  of  thromboembolism include  advanced  maternal  age,  increasing  parity,  multiple  gestations, operative delivery, bed rest, and obesity. Symptoms of DVT and PE may be mistaken for symptoms of normal pregnancy. Table 60-3 shows the various imaging modalities to consider for the diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. DVT and PE are treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin at usual doses. Warfarin is contraindicated (see Chapter 25).

# ASTHMA

Symptoms  of  acute  asthma  exacerbation  include  cough,  wheezing,  and dyspnea. Acute therapy includes maintenance of oxygen saturation > 95%, administration  of  inhaled β 2 -agonists,  systemic  corticosteroids,  and  fetal monitoring. Aerosolized ipratropium may be added in severely obstructed patients. Terbutaline sulfate , 0.25 mg SC every 20 minutes, may also be used. Subcutaneous epinephrine should be avoided, if possible. Peak expiratory  flow  rate  (PEFR)  is  not  altered  in  pregnancy,  with  goal  PEFR between  380  and  550  L/min.  Patients  who  are  discharged  home  should receive oral prednisone 40  to  60  mg/d  for  5  to  10  days  in  addition  to  a rescue β -agonist.

# ■ CYSTITIS AND PYELONEPHRITIS

Clinical features of cystitis and pyelonephritis are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, as are the causative microbes. Cystitis may be treated with nitrofurantoin ,  100  mg  PO  twice  daily  for  3  to  7  days,  while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be avoided due to concerns of fetal kernicterus during the third trimester. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines should also be avoided in pregnancy. Pregnant patients with pyelonephritis are  treated  aggressively  because  of  increased  risk  of  preterm  labor  and sepsis, and should be admitted for IV hydration and a second- or thirdgeneration cephalosporin. Many providers continue antibiotic suppression for the remainder of the pregnancy.

# ■ SICKLE CELL DISEASE

Pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at higher risk of miscarriage, preterm labor, and vasoocclusive crises. Clinical features, evaluation, and treatment are similar to nonpregnant patients. Management of vasoocclusive crisis includes aggressive hydration, analgesia, identification and treatment of the underlying cause, and fetal monitoring. Opiates can be used, while  NSAIDs should be avoided, particularly  after  32  weeks  gestation. Blood transfusion should be considered when conservative measures have failed, or with severe anemia, preeclampsia, hypoxemia, acute chest syndrome, or a new-onset neurological event.

# ■ HEADACHES

Headaches can be a presenting symptom of a wide variety of benign and life-threatening disorders, including intracranial hemorrhage, central vein thrombosis, mass, infection, and preeclampsia/eclampsia. Warning symptoms of potentially life-threatening disease include acute onset, postpartum headaches, neurological deficits, fever, and papilledema or retinal hemorrhages. If indicated, CT scan of the brain should be performed with appropriate shielding of the uterus. Migraine headaches should be treated with acetaminophen,  antiemetics  and,  if  necessary,  narcotics.  Ergot  alkaloids and triptans should not be used.

--- Page 353 ---

CHAPTER 60: Comorbid Diseases in Pregnancy

333

# ■ SEIZURE DISORDERS

Seizure  frequency  may  increase  in  patients  with  epilepsy  due  to  altered drug  pharmacokinetics.  Acute  seizure  management  is  similar  to  that  in nonpregnant patients, with emphasis on supplemental oxygen and left lateral decubitus positioning (see Chapter 145). Status epilepticus with prolonged  maternal  hypoxia  and  acidosis  has  a  high  mortality  rate  for  the mother and infant, and should be treated aggressively with early intubation and ventilation.

# ■ SUBSTANCE ABUSE

Cocaine use is associated with increased incidence of fetal death in utero, placental abruption, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal cerebral infarcts. Treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is unchanged in pregnancy. Acute opiate withdrawal in pregnant women can be treated with clonidine, 0.1 to 0.2  mg  SL  every  hour  as  needed  for  symptoms,  not  to  exceed  0.8  mg. Patients  should  be  referred  to  addiction  specialists  for  methadone  or buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. Alcohol use contributes to increased rates of  spontaneous  abortion,  low  birthweight,  preterm  deliveries,  and  fetal alcohol syndrome. Treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal does not differ from treatment in nonpregnant patients.

# ■ MEDICATIONS IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

Table  60-4  lists  common  emergency  department  medications  that  are known to be unsafe in pregnancy. For any drug not listed in the table, the National Library of Medicine provides detailed information online in the Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed).

# ■ DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING IN PREGNANCY

The threshold for teratogenesis from ionizing radiation is 10 rads, with the first  trimester  being  the  most  vulnerable  period.  The  effects  of  radiation exposure change with gestational age. No single test exceeds the teratogenic  threshold,  but  teratogenic  effects  of  multiple  imaging  should  be considered cumulatively. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have not been associated with teratogenic effects.

# ■ THROMBOEMBOLIC DISEASE OF PREGNANCY

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in industrialized nations. Symptoms are similar to those seen in nonpregnant women. Evaluation for DVT should begin with ultrasound of the lower extremities. If there is a concern for PE initiate the evaluation with a chest radiograph. d-dimer may not  be  helpful  to  diagnose  or  exclude  thromboembolic  disease  as  levels increase throughout pregnancy. Consensus guidelines recommend obtaining a V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiography next if the chest radiograph is  nondiagnostic. DVT and PE are treated with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight  heparin.  Do  not  use  warfarin  in  pregnancy  as  it crosses  the  placenta,  potentially  causing  fetal  CNS  abnormalities  and embryopathies such as bone and cartilage abnormalities as well as nasal and limb hypoplasia.

# ■ CHEST PAIN

The underlying causes of chest pain in pregnancy are similar to those of nonpregnant women. Some disorders, such as aortic dissection and cardiomyopathy, may be associated with pregnancy. Treat pregnant women with acute myocardial infarction with aspirin, heparin, and percutaneous intervention rather than thrombolytics. Treat congestive heart failure and pulmonary  edema with standard modalities except for  sodium  nitroprusside.  It should be avoided as it can cause thiocyanate and cyanide accumulation in the fetus.

# Chronic Hypertension

Chronic  hypertension is defined as blood pressure at or  above 140/90 mmHg prior to pregnancy, prior to 20 weeks' gestation or lasting more than 12 weeks after delivery. These patients are at risk for abruption, preeclampsia, low birth weight, cesarean delivery, premature birth, and fetal demise.

# Gestational Hypertension

Gestational  hypertension  is  defined  as  blood  pressure  at  or  above 140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks or in the immediate postpartum period but without proteinuria.

Hypertension  in  pregnancy  is  defined  as  a  systolic  blood  pressure ≥ 140 mmHg  or  diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg  on  two  occasions  at  least  4  hours apart in a woman who was normotensive prior to 20 weeks' gestation.

335

--- Page 356 ---

336 SECTION 8: Gynecology and Obstetrics

# Preeclampsia

Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension, greater than 140/90 mmHg, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart and proteinuria ≥ 300 mg in 24 hours in patients at 20 weeks' gestation until 4 to 6 weeks after delivery. In the absence  of  proteinuria,  thrombocytopenia  with  platelet  count  less  than 100,000, elevation of liver enzymes twice normal, new renal insufficiency with  a  creatinine  of  1.1  or  a  doubling  of  serum  creatinine,  pulmonary edema, or new-onset mental status disturbances or visual disturbances can be used to make the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Edema may or may not be present. Symptoms of severe preeclampsia reflect end-organ involvement and  may  include  headache,  visual  disturbances,  mental  status  changes, edema, oliguria, dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, and abdominal pain. Blood pressure in severe preeclampsia is typically elevated to 160/110 mmHg or more.

# HELLP Syndrome

HELLP syndrome is probably a clinical variant of preeclampsia. It is characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Patients usually complain of abdominal pain, especially epigastric and right upper quadrant pain. Because the blood pressure is not always elevated, HELLP syndrome should be considered in the evaluation of all pregnant women greater than  20 weeks' gestation with abdominal pain.

# Eclampsia

Eclampsia is preeclampsia with seizures.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Preeclampsia is a clinical diagnosis. The following laboratory abnormalities may be seen in severe preeclampsia: anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated  creatinine,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  elevated  LDH.  The  HELLP variant is diagnosed by laboratory tests: schistocytes on peripheral smear, platelet count lower than 150,000/mL, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase  and  alanine  aminotransferase  levels.  The  differential  diagnosis  of preeclampsia  includes  worsening  of  preexisting  hypertension,  transient hypertension, renal disease, fatty liver disease of pregnancy, and coagulation  disorders.  Focused  ultrasonography  or  a  CT  scan  of  the  pelvis  and abdomen should be done if concerns for subcapsular hematoma exist as this has a high risk of maternal and fetal mortality if ruptured.

CHAPTER 61: Emergencies After 20 Weeks 337

# ■ VAGINAL BLEEDING DURING THE SECOND HALF OF PREGNANCY

Placental abruption, placenta previa, and preterm labor are the most common causes of vaginal bleeding during the second half of pregnancy.

# Clinical Features

# Placental Abruption

Placental abruption, the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, must be considered in all pregnant females near term who present with painful vaginal bleeding. Clinical features include vaginal bleeding, abdominal  pain,  uterine  tenderness,  hypertonic  contractions,  increased uterine tone, fetal distress, and, in severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and fetal and/or maternal death. Vaginal bleeding may be mild or severe, depending on whether the area of abruption communicates to the cervical os. Abruption of greater than 50% of the placenta usually results in fetal demise. Be aware of the possibility of abruption after trauma, even minor trauma.

# Placenta Previa

Placenta  previa  is  the  implantation  of  the  placenta  over  the  cervical  os. Clinical features include painless, bright red vaginal bleeding. The amount of bleeding is frequently large as opposed to normal 'bloody show,' when a small amount of bright red blood and mucous are passed.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Transabdominal ultrasound should be obtained prior to performing speculum or digital pelvic examination to differentiate abruption placenta from placenta previa as it is contraindicated in previa. If transabdominal ultrasound is nondiagnostic, transvaginal ultrasound should be considered. The transvaginal  ultrasound  must  be  performed  by  someone  experienced  in transvaginal ultrasound, as positioning is extremely important. Ultrasound is very sensitive in detecting placenta previa but has limited sensitivity in diagnosing placental abruption.

# Premature Rupture of Membranes

Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is rupture of membranes before the onset of labor. Clinical presentation includes a rush of fluid or continuous leakage of fluid from the vagina. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding a pool of fluid in the posterior fornix with pH greater than 7.0 and a ferning pattern  on  smear.  Sterile  speculum  examination  may  be  done;  however, digital pelvic examination should be avoided because it increases the rate  of  infection  and  decreases  the  latent  period  from  rupture  until delivery. Tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, bacterial vaginosis, and group B Streptococcus should  be  performed.  Management  of  PROM  depends  on gestational age and maturity of the fetus, condition of the fetus, concern for infection, and presence of other complicating factors. Antibiotics and steroids may be appropriate. An obstetrics consultation should be obtained to assist with treatment and admission decisions.

# ■ PRETERM LABOR

# Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Preterm labor is defined as labor before 37 weeks' gestation. Clinical features include regular uterine contractions with effacement and dilatation of the cervix. Cervical fluid should be examined for possible PROM. Only after premature rupture  of  membranes  and  placenta  previa  have  been  excluded should digital examination be performed; use sterile gloves. Obtain tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, bacterial vaginosis, and group B Streptococcus . Perform an ultrasound for fetal age, weight, anatomy, and amniotic fluid level if possible but obstetric consultation should not be delayed awaiting results.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE

The differential diagnosis of hemorrhage in the first postpartum day includes uterine atony, uterine rupture, laceration of the lower genital tract, retained placental tissue, uterine inversion, and coagulopathy. After the first 24 hours, retained products of conception, uterine polyps, or coagulopathy such as von

CHAPTER 61: Emergencies After 20 Weeks

339

Willebrand disease are more likely causes. An enlarged and 'doughy' uterus suggests uterine atony; a vaginal mass suggests an inverted uterus. Bleeding despite good uterine tone and size may indicate retained products of conception or uterine rupture. The vagina and cervix must be inspected for lacerations. The first priority of ED management is stabilization of the patient with crystalloid IV fluids and/or packed red blood cells, if needed. CBC, clotting studies, and type and cross must be obtained. Uterine atony is treated with uterine massage and oxytocin 20 units in one liter of normal saline IV at 200 mL/h. Minor lacerations may be repaired in the ED. Extensive lacerations, retained products of conception, uterine inversion, or uterine rupture require emergency operative treatment by the obstetrician.

# ■ POSTPARTUM ENDOMETRITIS

Postpartum endometritis is a polymicrobial infection with symptoms that usually  begin  several  days  after  delivery.  Clinical  features  include  fever, lower  abdominal  pain,  and  foul-smelling  lochia.  Physical  examination reveals uterine or cervical motion tenderness and discharge. CBC, urinalysis, and cervical cultures should be obtained. Admission for antibiotic treatment is indicated for patients who appear ill, have had a cesarean section, or who have underlying comorbidities. Antibiotic regimens for outpatients may  include  clindamycin  or  doxycycline.  Do  not  use  doxycycline  in patients  who  are  breastfeeding.  Inpatient  regimens  include clindamycin 450  to  900  mg  IV  every  8  hours  plus gentamicin 1.5  mg/kg  IV  every  8 hours or cefoxitin 1 to 2  g IV every 6 hours.

# ■ MASTITIS

Mastitis is cellulitis of the periglandular breast tissue. Clinical features include swelling,  redness,  and  tender  engorgement  of  the  involved  portion  of  the breast, with or without fever and chills. Milk stasis presents similarly, except it lacks erythema, fever, or chills. For cellulitis, initiate treatment with dicloxacillin 500  mg orally four times daily or cephalexin 500  mg orally four times daily. Clindamycin 300  mg PO every 6 hours may be used in patients with penicillin allergy  or  if  concerns  about  MRSA  exist.  Oral  analgesics  may  be  needed. Patients should continue nursing on the affected breast. However, in cases of purulent discharge, the mother should pump and discard the milk rather than nurse. Differentiate mastitis from breast abscess using bedside ultrasound.

# ■ AMNIOTIC FLUID EMBOLISM

Amniotic fluid embolism is a sudden, catastrophic illness with mortality rates of 60% to 80%. Clinical features include sudden cardiovascular collapse with hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, altered mental status, seizures, and DIC along with sudden onset of fetal distress. Death can occur rapidly. Treatment is supportive; treat hypoxia, hypotension, and hypoperfusion.

Precipitous delivery in an emergency setting can be a source of significant anxiety for an emergency physician. While emergency delivery is a relatively uncommon occurrence, careful preparation and education can help in avoiding  serious  complications,  and  result  in  a  positive  outcome  for  the mother and child.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Any pregnant woman who is beyond 20 weeks' gestation and appears to be  in  active  labor  should  be  evaluated  expeditiously.  Initial  evaluation should include complete maternal vital signs and fetal heart monitoring. A persistently slow or fast fetal heart rate (less  than  110  beats/min  or greater  than  160  beats/min)  is  an  indicator  of  fetal  distress.  History includes frequency and time of onset of contractions, leakage of fluid, vaginal bleeding, estimated gestational age, and prenatal care. A focused physical examination should include an abdominal examination evaluating fundal height, abdominal or uterine tenderness, and fetal position. A bimanual  or  sterile  speculum  examination  should  be  performed  if  no contraindications exist such as active vaginal bleeding. After the exam, place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position to prevent maternal hypotension.

False  labor  is  characterized  by  irregular,  brief  contractions  usually confined to the lower abdomen. These typically painless contractions, commonly called Braxton-Hicks contractions, are irregular in intensity and duration. True labor is characterized by painful, regular contractions of steadily increasing intensity and duration leading to progressive cervical  dilatation.  True  labor  typically  begins  in  the  fundal  region  and upper abdomen and radiates into the pelvis and lower back.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Patients without vaginal bleeding should be assessed with sterile speculum  and  bimanual  examinations  to  evaluate  the  progression  of  labor, cervical dilation, and rupture of membranes. Patients with active vaginal bleeding require initial evaluation with ultrasound to rule out placenta previa. Spontaneous rupture of membranes typically occurs with a  gush  of  clear  or  blood-tinged  fluid.  If  ruptured  membranes  are  suspected, a sterile speculum examination should be performed and amniotic  fluid  obtained  from  the  fornix  or  vaginal  vault. Amniotic  fluid  is alkaline, will stain Nitrazine paper dark blue and will 'fern' if dried on a slide. The presence of meconium in amniotic fluid should be noted. Avoid digital examinations in the preterm patient in whom prolongation of gestation is desired as even one examination increases the chance of infection.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

If the cervix is dilated in a woman experiencing active contractions, further transport, even short distances, may be hazardous. Preparations should be made for emergency delivery. Assess fetal position by physical examination, and confirm by ultrasound, if possible. Place the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position. Notify an obstetrician, if one is available.

# ■ ShOULDER DYSTOCIA

Initially recognized after the delivery of the fetal head, when routine downward traction is insufficient to deliver the anterior shoulder. The anterior shoulder is trapped behind the pubic symphysis.

# ■ BREECh pRESENTATION

The primary concern with breech presentation is head entrapment.

# ■ pOSTpARTUM CARE

The placenta should be allowed to separate spontaneously and assisted with gentle traction. Aggressive traction on the cord risks uterine inversion, tearing of the cord, or disruption of the placenta, which can result in severe vaginal bleeding. After removal of the placenta, gently massage the uterus to promote contraction. Infuse oxytocin 10 to 40  U/1000  mL NS at a moderate rate to maintain uterine contraction. Oxytocin may also be given as 10  U  IM. Episiotomy or laceration repair may be delayed until an experienced obstetrician is able to close the laceration and inspect the patient for fourth-degree (rectovaginal) tears.

Causes of vulvovaginitis include infections, irritants, allergies, reaction to foreign  bodies,  and  atrophy.  The  normal  vaginal  flora  help  maintain  an acidic pH between 3.8 and 4.5, which decreases pathogen growth.

# ■ BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of malodorous vaginal discharge. However, up to 50% of infected women are asymptomatic. BV occurs when vaginal lactobacilli are replaced by anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis , Mycoplasma , and Ureaplasma .

# Clinical Features

The most common symptom is malodorous or 'fishy smelling' vaginal discharge. Vaginal irritation, excoriation, fissures, and edema are uncommon. A combination of history, vaginal examination, and point-of-care testing confirm the diagnosis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis can be made if three of the following four criteria are present:  (1)  vaginal  discharge,  (2)  vaginal  pH  greater  than  4.5,  (3)  positive amine test (fishy odor when 10% KOH is added to the discharge), and (4) clue cells seen on saline wet preparation.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treat with metronidazole 500 mg PO twice daily for 7 days. Clindamycin 2% intravaginal cream at night for 7 days or metronidazole 0.75% intravaginal gel daily for 5 days are alternatives. Treatment is not recommended for male partners or asymptomatic women. To avoid a disulfram-like reaction,  patients  treated  with  metronidazole should refrain from alcohol use during treatment and for 24 hours after ending treatment.

All symptomatic pregnant women should be treated, and women at high risk of preterm labor should be considered for treatment. Preferred treatment  in  pregnancy  is metronidazole 250  mg  PO  twice  daily  for 7 days.

# ■ CANDIDA VAGINITIS

Candida albicans is the second most common cause of infectious vaginitis. Conditions  that  promote Candida vaginitis  include  systemic  antibiotics, diabetes, pregnancy, hormone replacement therapy, and birth control pills. Incidence  is  decreased  in  postmenopausal  patients.  Candidiasis  is  not typically considered a sexually transmitted disease, though it can be transmitted sexually.

344

--- Page 365 ---

CHAPTER 63: Vulvovaginitis 345

# Clinical Features

The most common symptom of Candida vaginitis is pruritus. Other symptoms include vaginal discharge, external dysuria, and dyspareunia. Exam may  reveal  vulvar  and  vaginal  edema,  erythema,  and  a  thick  'cottage cheese' discharge.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is confirmed if vaginal pH is 4 to 4.5 and budding yeast or pseudohyphae are present on microscopy. Ten percent KOH dissolves vaginal epithelial cells, leaving yeast buds and pseudohyphae intact and easier to see.  Use  of  KOH  increases  the  sensitivity  to  80%,  with  a  specificity approaching 100%.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Single-dose  treatment  with fluconazole ,  150  mg  PO,  is  as  effective  as topical treatments. Almost all topically applied azoles are equally efficacious and available over-the-counter. Treatment options include clotrimazole , butoconazole , miconazole , terconazole , and tioconazole in several strengths and formulations. Pregnant patients should avoid oral fluconazole and instead  use  intravaginal  agents  for  7  days.  For  nonpregnant  patients with complicated candidiasis, fluconazole 150 mg PO is given on days 1 and 3.

# ■ TRICHOMONAS VAGINITIS

Trichomoniasis  is  a  common  sexually  transmitted  disease  caused  by  the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis .

# Clinical Features

Presenting symptoms include a frothy, malodorous vaginal discharge, pruritus, and vaginal irritation. However, up to 50% of women harboring the organism are asymptomatic.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Saline  wet  prep  shows  motile,  pear-shaped,  flagellated  trichomonads. Microscopy should be performed immediately after obtaining the sample or the organisms may lose motility. The sensitivity of microscopy is 60% to 70%. The sensitivity of culture is 95% but results are not readily available  in  the  ED.  New  point-of-care  PCR-based  tests  are  now  available as well.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The treatment of choice for trichomoniasis is metronidazole 2 g single oral dose or tinidazole 2 g single oral dose. Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is recommended for patients who fail single-dose therapy. Metronidazole gel is much less efficacious and thus not recommended for use. Sexual  partners  should  be  treated  to  avoid  retransmission  of  disease. Patients should also be counseled to abstain from sexual activity until treatment course is completed and they are asymptomatic.

# ■ CONTACT VULVOVAGINITIS

Common causes of contact vulvovaginitis include douches, soaps, bubble baths, deodorants, perfumes, feminine hygiene products, topical antibiotics, and tight undergarments. Patients complain of perineal burning, itching, and local swelling. Examination findings may include redness, edema, and ulceration. Vaginal pH changes may promote overgrowth of Candida , obscuring the primary problem.

Try to  identify  the  precipitating  agent  and  rule  out  infectious  causes. Most cases resolve spontaneously when the precipitant is withdrawn. For more severe reactions, cool sitz baths, compresses with Burow's solution, and  topical  corticosteroids  may  help.  Oral  antihistamines  are  drying  but may be helpful if a true allergy is identified. Concomitant Candida infections should be treated as previously discussed.

# ■ VAGINAL FOREIGN BODIES

Patients with a vaginal foreign body present with chronic, foul-smelling or bloody  discharge.  In  younger  girls,  common  items  include  toilet  paper, toys, and small household objects. Items seen in adults include a forgotten or irretrievable tampon, packets of illegal drugs, or items used for sexual stimulation. Removal of the object is usually curative.

# ■ ATROphIC VAGINITIS

After menopause, the lack of estrogen stimulation leads to vaginal mucosal atrophy with a subsequent loss of resistance to minor trauma or infection. Bleeding can occur. The vaginal pH also increases, and subsequent changes  in  the  vaginal  flora  can  predispose  to  bacterial  infection  with purulent  discharge.  Treatment  consists  primarily  of  topical  estrogen creams.  Estrogen  creams  should  not  be  prescribed  in  the  emergency department for women with prior reproductive tract cancer or postmenopausal bleeding.

# ■ BARThOLIN GLAND CYST AND ABSCESS

Bartholin glands are located in the labia minora at the 4 and 8 o'clock position.  Obstruction  of  the  gland  may  result  in  cyst  or  abscess  formation. Patients  present  with  pain  and  swelling  that  develops  over  several  days. Exam  will  reveal  pain,  induration,  and  fluctuance.  Patients  without  an abscess may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, analgesics, and sitz baths. In addition, patients with an abscess require an incision and drainage with the placement of a Word catheter and referral for definitive surgical management.

# Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Abigail D. Hankin

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) comprises a spectrum of infections of the  female  upper  reproductive  tract,  including  endometritis,  salpingitis, tubo-ovarian  abscess,  and  pelvic  peritonitis. Neisseria  gonorrhoeae and Chlamydiatrachomatis are  frequently  isolated  pathogens;  however,  many other  microorganisms  have  been  associated  with  PID,  including  vaginal flora, gram-negative rods, streptococci, and mycoplasmas. Risk factors for PID include age (teenagers are at greatest risk), multiple sexual partners, a new  sexual  partner  within  the  past  30  days,  presence  of  other  sexually transmitted  diseases,  and  intrauterine  device  insertion  within  the  prior  3 weeks.  PID  occurs  less  commonly  in  pregnancy,  but  is  associated  with increased  maternal  morbidity  and  preterm  labor.  Complications  of  PID include significantly increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pain, even after only a single episode of PID.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical diagnosis of PID is complicated due to the wide variation in symptoms and clinical findings. Common presenting complaints include lower abdominal pain (seen in > 90%), vaginal discharge (75%), vaginal bleeding,  urinary  discomfort,  fever,  nausea,  and  vomiting.  Many  women  with PID may have nonspecific or very subtle symptoms. Physical exam may show lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, or uterine/ adnexal tenderness. Mucopurulent cervicitis is a common finding, and its absence should prompt consideration of alternative causes of the patient's symptoms.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Given  the  clinical  variability  in  the  diagnosis  of  PID  and  the  potential sequelae of delayed treatment, the United States Centers for Disease Control  and  Prevention recommends empiric treatment for PID based on the minimal criteria  listed  in  Table  64-1.  No  single  laboratory  test  is  highly sensitive or specific for PID. Laboratory evaluation should include a pregnancy test, wet preparation of vaginal secretions, and DNA probe or culture for N.  gonorroheae and Chlamydia  trachomatis .  Treatment,  when  indicated, should not be delayed pending test results.

The differential diagnosis includes gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous or septic abortion, ovarian cyst, pyelonephritis, and renal colic.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are no longer recommended to treat gonorrhea in the United States. Fluoroquinolones may be an alternative treatment option for disseminated gonococcal infection if antimicrobial susceptibility can be documented.

The  most  common  reasons  for  emergency  department  visits  during  the postoperative  period  after  gynecologic  procedures  are  pain,  fever,  and vaginal bleeding. A focused but thorough evaluation should be performed, including  sterile  speculum  and  bimanual  examination.  Consultation  with the gynecologist who performed the procedure is indicated.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF ENDOSCOPIC PROCEDURES

# Laparoscopy

The major complications associated with laparoscopy are thermal injury of the bowel, viscus perforation, hemorrhage, vascular injury, ureteral or bladder injuries, incisional hernia, and wound dehiscence. Bowel injury should be suspected if pain is greater than expected after laparoscopy. Thermal injury is easily missed due to delayed development of symptoms for several days to weeks postoperatively. Patients with the above typically  present  with  bilateral  lower  abdominal  pain,  fever,  elevated white blood cell count, and peritonitis. X-rays can show an ileus or free air  under  the  diaphragm.  Early  gynecology  consultation  should  be obtained.

# Hysteroscopy

Complications of hysteroscopy are rare but include uterine perforation, postoperative  bleeding,  fluid  overload  from  absorption  of  distention media,  gas  embolism,  and  infection.  Bleeding  may  originate  from  the uterus after resection or the cervix due to lacerations or tears. Management  includes  packing  of  the  vaginal  vault  and  consultation  with  a gynecologist.

# ■ OTHER COMPLICATIONS OF GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES

# Vaginal Cuff Cellulitis

Cuff  cellulitis ,  a  common  early  complication  after  hysterectomy,  is  an infection  of  the  contiguous  retroperitoneal  space  immediately  above  the vaginal apex and the surrounding soft tissue. Patients typically present with fever,  abdominal  pain,  pelvic  pain,  back  pain,  and  purulent  vaginal  discharge. Cuff tenderness and induration plus purulent discharge are prominent during the gynecologic exam. Abscesses are rare, but will present as a fluctuant mass near the cuff approximately 10 to 14 days postoperatively. Treat  with  broad-spectrum  antibiotics.  Recommended  regimens  include imipenem-cilastatin , gentamicin and clindamycin , or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole . Admit for continuation of antibiotics and consideration of drainage by interventional radiology.

CHAPTER 65: Complications of Gynecologic Procedures 351

# Postoperative Wound Infection

Patients with wound infections generally present with fever and increasing pain at the surgical site. Onset is typically within 2 weeks of surgery. Exam will reveal erythema, tenderness, induration, and possibly incisional drainage.  Treatment  includes  drainage  and  antibiotic  treatment  directed  at methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. Patients with invasive infections should be admitted.

# Ureteral Injury

Ureteral injury can occur during abdominal hysterectomy, resulting from crushing, transecting, or ligating trauma. These patients present soon after surgery with flank pain. They may also complain of fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and hematuria. The workup includes a urinalysis and a CT  scan  with  IV  contrast  or  an  intravenous  pyelogram  to  evaluate  for obstruction. These patients should be admitted for ureteral catheterization and  possible  repair,  although  delayed  repair  after  percutaneous  nephrostomy is also acceptable.

# Vesicovaginal Fistula

Vesicovaginal  fistulas  can  occur  after  abdominal  hysterectomy.  Patients typically  present  10  to  14  days  following  surgery  with  a  watery  vaginal discharge. Placing a cotton tampon in the vagina and instilling methylene blue  through  a  urinary  catheter  can  confirm  the  diagnosis.  The  tampon should stain within 20 minutes. Management includes placement of a Foley catheter and prompt gynecologic consultation.

# Postconization Bleeding

The most common complication associated with loop electrocautery, laser ablation, and cold-knife conization of the cervix is bleeding, which can be rapid and excessive. Delayed hemorrhage can occur 1 to 2 weeks postoperatively.  Direct  visualization  of  the  bleeding  site  is  required.  Applying Monsel's solution, direct pressure for 5 minutes with a large cotton swab, or cauterization with silver nitrate is a reasonable first step. If unsuccessful, the bleeding site may be better visualized and treated in the OR.

# Septic Pelvic Thrombophlebitis

Septic  pelvic  thrombophlebitis  is  a  rare  complication  that  may  follow cesarean delivery or hysterectomy. The presenting complaint is typically abdominal pain and fever. CT and MRI aid in the diagnosis but do not exclude the disease if negative. Patients are admitted for anticoagulation and IV antibiotics.

# Induced Abortion

Complications associated with induced abortion may be characterized by time of occurence. These include uterine perforation, cervical lacerations, retained products of conception, and postabortal endometritis (Table 65-1). Patients with retained products of conception usually present with excessive bleeding and abdominal pain. Pelvic examination reveals an enlarged and tender uterus with an open cervical os. A pelvic ultrasound should be

done  to  confirm  the  diagnosis.  Treatment  is  dilatation  and  curettage  or medical  management  with  misoprostol.  Endometritis  can  occur  with  or without  retained  products  of  conception  and  is  treated  with  antibiotics. Women who are Rh negative require Rh 0 immunoglobulin ,  300 μ g IM, after spontaneous or induced abortion.

# Assisted Reproductive Technology

Complications related to ultrasound-guided aspiration of oocytes include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, pelvic infection, intraperitoneal bleeding, and adnexal torsion. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can be a lifethreatening complication of assisted reproduction. Mild cases present with abdominal  distention,  ovarian  enlargement,  and  weight  gain.  In  severe cases, patients have rapid weight gain, tense ascites from third spacing of fluid into the abdomen, pleural effusions, hemodynamic instability, oliguria or electrolyte abnormalities. Renal impairment and increased coagulability may also be noted. Avoid bimanual pelvic exam to prevent rupturing the ovaries.  Workup  includes  CBC,  electrolytes,  liver  enzymes,  coagulation studies, and type and crossmatch. Initiate IV volume replacement and consult with gynecology for admission.

# Postembolization Syndrome

Postembolization  syndrome consists  of  postprocedure  pelvic  pain,  fever, and  leukocytosis  lasting  up  to  7  days  caused  by  myometrial  and  fibroid ischemia and necrosis after uterine fibroid embolization. Exam may reveal vaginal discharge of fibroid expulsion. Evaluate patients for other causes of fever  and  provide  pain  control.  Patients  with  inadequate  pain  control  or those in whom an infection is present may require admission.

# Fever and Serious Bacterial Illness in Children

Todd P. Chang

# ■ FEVER AND SERIOUS BACTERIAL ILLNESS (SBI)

Fever is the most common pediatric chief complaint presenting to an emergency department (ED) and accounts for 30% of outpatient visits. Infants and children are at relatively high risk for serious bacterial illness (SBI), which  includes  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  pneumonia,  bacteremia  or sepsis, and meningitis-in decreasing prevalence. Neonates are at the highest risk due to their immature immune response, while infants from 1 to 3 months of age gradually transition to the lower risk profile of older infants and children. The incidence of UTI is 5% overall in children 2 months to 2 years, with a prevalence of 3% to 8% in all febrile children visiting an ED. Widespread vaccination has dropped the incidence of occult bacteremia for children  3  to  36  months  of  age  to  0.5%  to  0.7%,  with  further  decreases expected with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Meningitis risk decreases from about 1% in the first month of life to < 0.1% later in infancy and childhood.

# Clinical Features

In the neonate or infant < 3 months of age, the threshold for concerning fever  is  38°C  (100.4°F);  in  infants  and  children  3  to  36  months  old,  the threshold is 39°C (102.2°F). In general, higher temperatures are associated with a higher incidence of SBI. Immature development may make reliable examination of younger infants difficult. Persistent crying, inability to console,  poor  feeding,  or  temperature  instability  may  be  the  only  findings suggestive of an SBI. In the neonate, there may not be any findings other than fever.

# Diagnosis and Differential

# Infants < 3 months

An ill-appearing infant should be managed aggressively for SBI, with full sepsis evaluation, parenteral antibiotics, and admission, but a well-appearing febrile infant less than 3 months of age presents a challenge because history

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

and  physical  examination  are  rarely  helpful  in  diagnosing  or  excluding SBI in this age group. Meningismus is rarely present; rales may not be appreciated  without  strong  negative  inspiratory  forces;  and  bacteremia occurs even in the well-appearing infant. A history of cough, tachypnea, or hypoxemia (by pulse oximetry), however, should alert the examiner to a possible lower respiratory tract infection and consideration of the diagnosis of pneumonia.

All febrile infants 0 to 28 days of age should receive full SBI evaluations, admission, and empiric antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic coverage in this age group includes ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV for Listeria monocytogenes and either gentamicin 2.5 mg/kg IV or cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV for other common organisms. Avoid using ceftriaxone in this age group. Sepsis testing  includes  complete  blood  count  (CBC),  blood  culture,  urinalysis  and urine culture, and lumbar puncture for CSF indices and culture. Obtain a chest radiograph if any respiratory signs described above are present, and order stool studies if the infant has diarrhea.

Febrile  infants  29  to  90  days  old  without  a  focal  source  may  be stratified to low or high risk of SBI using one of three classic criteria: Rochester  Criteria,  Boston  Criteria,  or  Philadelphia  Protocol.  To  meet low-risk  SBI  status,  the  infant  must  be  well-appearing  with  a  normal urinalysis and normal White Blood Cell (WBC) count, between 5,000/ mm 3   and  15,000/mm 3   for  the  Rochester  and  Philadelphia,  and  5,000/ mm 3  and 20,000/mm 3  for Boston. A negative CSF (WBC < 10 per hpf in  Boston  and WBC < 8  per  hpf  in  Philadelphia)  is  also  required  for Boston and Philadelphia, and each criteria set has other parameters to complete a low-risk status (Table 66-1). Obtain a chest radiograph for infants  with  a  suggestion  of  lower  respiratory  tract  disease. Although there  is  evidence  to  support  the  use  of  any  of  these  three  criteria,  the overall incidence of bacteremia is dropping due to two factors: empiric antibiotic treatment of women testing positive for Group B streptococcus during  the  third  trimester  and  the  effects  from  herd  immunity  from Haemophilus and pneumococcal vaccines.

All  ill-appearing  infants  should  receive  parenteral  antibiotic  therapy (Table 66-2) and be admitted to the hospital. Infants older than 28 days at low risk for SBI may be managed conservatively as inpatients with ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IM/IV pending cultures; as inpatients without antibiotics; as outpatients with ceftriaxone; or as outpatients without antibiotics. The key deciding factor should be the physician's comfort level and the ability for  close  follow-up,  typically  within  12  to  24  hours.  If  antibiotics  are administered  (inpatient  or  outpatient),  obtain  CSF  and  urine  and  blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics.

Well-appearing  febrile  infants  between  the  ages  of  29  and  90  days with an identifiable viral source of infection (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] or influenza) should have urinary tract infection (UTI) and bacteremia ruled out before being discharged from the ED. Chest radiographs should be obtained at the discretion of the clinician, but are not indicated  for  well-appearing  infants  over  29  days  with  RSV.  Consider deferring  lumbar  puncture  if  a  virus  is  identified  as  the  cause  of  the symptoms.

Some evidence supports the use of serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to differentiate SBI from viral illness.

# Infants 3 to 36 Months

Physical examination findings become more reliable with increasing age, though meningeal signs remain unreliable up to 2 years old. Viral illnesses account  for  most  febrile  illnesses  in  this  age  group.  Diagnostic  testing should be guided by clinical findings, including ill appearance; however, UTIs are still  prevalent  in  this  age  group,  even  with  no  focal  symptoms besides fever. Females prior to toilet training, circumcised boys younger than 6 months of age, and uncircumcised boys under 1 year of age are at risk for occult UTI. Obtain both a urinalysis and urine culture (by catheterization or suprapubic tap) if a source for the fever is not otherwise identified.  Consider  CBC  and  blood  culture  for  bacteremia/sepsis  and  CSF studies for meningitis, although these are much less common.

# Older Febrile Children

The risk for bacteremia in children older than 3 years is < 0.2%. CBC and blood cultures are not routinely recommended in immunized older children with  fever.  Etiologies  to  consider  in  older  febrile  children  include  viral infections, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis. Testing is directed by clinical presentation.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

For the management of pneumonia, see Chapter 71 ; for the management of UTI, see Chapter 75 ; and infections of the ears, nose, and throat are covered in Chapter 68 . Fever is not typically harmful to children, although it makes children  uncomfortable  and  may  potentiate  seizures.  Counsel  parents against "fever phobia." To reduce a fever:

Patients who are called to return to the ED for evaluation of positive blood  cultures  require  repeat  evaluation.  Patients  with  positive  blood cultures without contaminants should be hospitalized and treated with parenteral antibiotics. Well-appearing afebrile children already on antibiotics should complete the course of therapy. If the patient is afebrile, clinically well, without a focus of infection, and not currently on antibiotics, repeat testing  or  treatment  is  not  usually  necessary.  If  the  child  with  a  positive blood culture remains febrile or continues to appear ill, a full sepsis workup (CBC, repeat blood culture, lumbar puncture, urinalysis, and urine culture) should be performed. The patient should be hospitalized and given parenteral antibiotics (Table 66-3).

# ■ SEPSIS

Sepsis (bacteremia with clinical evidence of systemic infection) can rapidly progress to multiorgan failure and death. Risk factors include prematurity, immunocompromised  state,  recent  invasive  procedures,  and  indwelling foreign objects such as catheters.

# Clinical Features

Clinical signs may be vague and subtle in the young infant, including lethargy,  poor  feeding,  irritability,  or  hypotonia.  Fever  is  common;  however, very  young  infants  may  be  hypothermic. Tachypnea  and  tachycardia  are usually present as a result of fever but also may be secondary to hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Sepsis can rapidly progress to shock, manifest as prolonged capillary refill, decreased peripheral pulses, altered mental status,  and  decreased  urinary  output.  Hypotension  is  usually  a  late  sign  of septic shock in infants and children; sustained tachycardia for age is often the only sign available to the clinician of impending shock.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis  is  based  on  clinical  findings  and  confirmed  by  positive  blood culture results. Though international criteria for sepsis have been published, all  infants  who  appear  toxic  should  be  considered  septic. The  laboratory evaluation of a child with presumed sepsis includes CBC, blood culture, complete metabolic panel, blood lactate, catheterized urinalysis with culture and sensitivities, chest radiograph, lumbar puncture, and stool studies in the presence of diarrhea. Infants are at particular risk for hypoglycemia with SBI and sepsis, and a glucose level should always be checked.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ MENINGITIS

Meningitis  is  usually  a  complication  of  a  primary  bacteremia  and  has  a peak incidence in children between birth and 2 years of age. Prematurity and immature immunity put children at higher risk.

--- Page 379 ---

CHAPTER 66: Fever and Serious Bacterial Illness in Children

359

# Clinical Features

Meningitis may present with the subtle signs that accompany less serious infections,  such  as  otitis  media  or  sinusitis.  Irritability,  inconsolability, hypotonia, and lethargy are most common in infants. Older children may complain of headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting and exhibit the classic signs of meningismus with complaints of neck pain. Occasionally, meningitis presents as a rapidly progressive, fulminant disease characterized by shock, seizures, or coma, or with febrile status epilepticus.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is made by lumbar puncture and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF should be examined for white blood cells, glucose and protein, Gram stain, and culture. Consider herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR in the seizing neonate and any child with CSF pleocytosis or xanthochromia.  In  the  presence  of  known  immunocompromised  state,  consider infections with opportunistic or unusual organisms. Perform cranial computed tomography before lumbar puncture in the presence of focal neurologic signs or increased intracranial pressure.

† Meningismus is difficult to discern in infants < 6 months of age, and especially in infants < 2 months of age. Therefore, we recommend routine CSF testing in infants < 2 months of age, but selective CSF testing in infants 2-6 months of age. There is no absolute cutoff point for prediction of meningitis with a peripheral WBC count.

# ■ FURThER READING

For  further  reading  in Tintinalli's  Emergency  Medicine:  A  Comprehensive  Study Guide ,  8th ed., see Chapter 116, 'Fever and Serious Bacterial Illness in Infants and Children,' by Vincent J. Wang.

--- Page 381 ---

In general, the signs and symptoms of illness are vague and nonspecific in neonates making the identification of specific diagnoses challenging. The survival of premature infants has produced a population of children whose corrected gestational age (chronological age since birth in weeks minus the number of weeks of prematurity) makes them, in many ways, similar to neonates. Neonates present to the emergency department (ED) with conditions ranging from normal to critical.

# ■ WEIGHT GAIN, FEEDING, AND STOOLING

Bottle-fed infants generally take 6 to 9 feedings (2 to 4 oz) in a 24-hour period, with a relatively stable pattern developing by the end of the first month of  life.  Breast-fed  infants  generally  prefer  feedings  every  1  to  3 hours. Infants may lose up to 12% of their birth weight during the first 3 to 7 days of life. After this time, infants are expected to gain about 1 oz/d (20 to 30 g/d) during the first 3 months of life. Parental perception that an infant's food intake is inadequate may prompt an ED visit. If the patient's weight  gain  is  adequate  and  the  infant  appears  satisfied  after  feeding, parental reassurance is appropriate.

Regurgitation  occurs  when  gastric  contents  are  effortlessly  expelled, typically  within  30  minutes  of  feeding,  and,  though  potentially  large  in volume, are  never  projectile  or  bilious.  Regurgitation  is  typically  a  selflimited condition and if an infant is thriving and gaining weight appropriately, reassurance is appropriate.

Vomiting is differentiated from regurgitation by forceful contraction of the  diaphragm and abdominal muscles. Vomiting has a variety of causes and  is  rarely  an  isolated  symptom.  Etiologies  are  diverse  and  include increased  intracranial  pressure  (e.g.,  nonaccidental  trauma),  infections (e.g., urinary tract infections, sepsis, or gastroenteritis), hepatobiliary disease (usually accompanied by jaundice), and inborn errors of metabolism (usually  accompanied  by  hypoglycemia  and  metabolic  acidosis).  Bilious vomiting in a neonate or infant should be considered a surgical emergency with particular concern for malrotation with midgut volvulus.

The number, color, and consistency of stool in the same infant changes from day to day and differs among infants. Normal breast-fed infants may go 5 to 7 days without stooling or have six to seven stools per day. Color has no significance unless blood is present, or the stool is acholic (i.e., white).

Infants  without  normal  stooling  in  the  first  2  days  of  life  may  have anatomic anomalies (e.g.,  intestinal  stenosis  or  atresias),  cystic  fibrosis, Hirschsprung disease, or meconium ileus or plug. Constipation that develops  later  in  the  first  month  of  life  suggests  Hirschsprung  disease, hypothyroidism, anal stenosis, or anterior anus. Although bacterial infection may cause bloody diarrhea, this is rare in neonates. The most common cause of blood in the stool in neonates is anal fissures. Breast-fed infants may  have  heme-positive  stool  from  swallowed  maternal  blood  due  to

361

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

bleeding nipples. Necrotizing enterocolitis may present as bloody diarrhea and usually presents with other signs of sepsis (e.g.,  jaundice,  lethargy, fever, poor feeding, or abdominal distention). Abdominal radiography may demonstrate  pneumatosis  intestinalis  or  free  air.  Dehydrated  neonates should be admitted for parenteral rehydration.

Abdominal distention can be normal in the neonate and is usually due to lax abdominal muscles, relatively large intraabdominal organs, and swallowed air. In general, if the neonate appears comfortable, is feeding well, and the abdomen is soft, there is no need for concern.

# ■ BrEATHING AND CrYING

A  normal  respiratory  rate  for  a  neonate  is  from  30  to  60  breaths/min. Periodic  breathing  manifests  as  alternating  episodes  of  rapid  breathing with brief ( < 5 to 10 seconds) pauses in respiration. Periodic breathing is usually normal in neonates. Apnea is formally defined as a cessation of respiration for longer than 10 to 20 seconds with or without accompanying  bradycardia  and  cyanosis. Apnea  generally  signifies  critical  illness including infection, CNS injury, and metabolic disease, and prompt investigation and admission for monitoring and treatment should be initiated. Apnea may be the first  sign  of  bronchiolitis  with  respiratory  syncytial virus in neonates and can occur before wheezing. Chlamydia and pertussis can also cause apnea in the young infant.

Noisy  breathing  in  a  neonate  is  usually  benign.  Infectious  causes  of stridor seen commonly in older infants and young children (e.g., croup) are rare in neonates. Stridor in a neonate is often due to a congenital anomaly, most commonly, laryngomalacia. Other causes include webs, cysts, atresias,  stenoses,  clefts,  and  airway  hemangiomas. Nasal congestion from a mild  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  may  cause  significant  respiratory problems in a neonate. Neonates are obligate nasal breathers and feed for relatively prolonged periods while breathing only through their noses. The use of saline drops and nasal suctioning is typically effective.

There are benign to life-threatening causes of prolonged crying in infants. True inconsolability represents a serious condition in most infants and requires investigation  for  injury  (accidental  or  inflicted),  infection,  supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), corneal abrasion, hair tourniquet, hernia or testicular torsion, or an abdominal emergency. If, after a thorough ED evaluation, a cause for  excessive  crying  has  not  been  identified  and  the  child  continues  to  be inconsolable, admission to the hospital for further evaluation is warranted.

Intestinal  colic  is  a  common  cause  of  crying  in  infants.  The  cause  is unknown. The incidence is about 13% in neonates. The formal definition includes crying for at least 3 hours per day for at least 3 days per week over a 3-week period. Intestinal colic seldom lasts beyond 3 months of age. No effective treatment has been identified. In general, the initial diagnosis of colic is not made in the ED and it is a diagnosis of exclusion.

# ■ SLEEpING, SEIZUrES, AND SEEMINGLY ABNOrMAL MOVEMENTS

Normal newborns awaken at variable intervals that can range from about 20 minutes to 6 hours. Neonates and young infants tend to have no differentiation between day and night until approximately 3 months of age. Seizures

--- Page 383 ---

CHAPTER 67: Common Neonatal Problems

363

in  neonates  may  present  with  subtle  signs  and  symptoms  including  eye deviation,  tongue  thrusting,  eyelid  fluttering,  periods  of  apnea,  pedaling movements  or  arching.  All  seizures  in  neonates,  unlike  some  in  older infants and young children, require an extensive workup including testing of serum calcium level and admission to the hospital. Seizures need to be differentiated from benign conditions such as a Moro reflex or benign neonatal  sleep  myoclonus.  Benign  neonatal  sleep  myoclonus  was  first described  in  1982  and  consists  of  lightning-like  rhythmic  jerks  of  the extremities  when  the  infant  is  sleeping,  is  stopped  when  the  neonate  is touched or awakened, occurs only during sleep, requires no workup, and is best handled with reassurance.

# ■ FEVEr AND SEpSIS

Fever in the neonate (age 28 days or younger) is defined as the history of documented fever by a parent or presence of a rectal temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher in the ED. Fever in the neonate must be taken seriously, and at this point in time the proper management includes a complete sepsis workup,  administration  of  parenteral  antibiotics  (e.g.,  cefotaxime  and ampicillin), and admission to the hospital. For further detailed discussion, see Chapter 66.

# ■ ALTE/BrUE

An apparent life-threatening event (ALTE), recently renamed brief resolved unexplained  event  (BRUE)  by  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 12 months involving a brief, but now resolved episode of one or more of the following: (1) cyanosis  or  pallor;  (2)  irregular,  decreased,  or  absent  breathing;  (3)  hyper-  or hypotonia;  or  (4)  altered  responsiveness.  According  to  the  definition  of BRUE, these infants appear well on presentation to the ED and there is no explanation of the qualifying event. The new guidelines emphasize categorization into lower risk and higher risk, with lower risk criteria being: (1) age > 60  days;  (2)  prematurity ≥ 32  weeks,  and  postconceptional  age ≥ 45 weeks; (3) first BRUE; (4) duration of event < 1 minute; (5) no CPR by a healthcare provider; 6) no concerning historical or physical examination features. If not considered lower risk, they are categorized as higher risk. Recommendations for further evaluation of lower risk patients show limited benefit, but the strength of the evidence to support these recommendations is only moderate to poor. Evaluation for higher risk patients may include a complete blood count; electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and ammonia levels; urine toxicological screen; chest radiograph; electrocardiogram; testing for respiratory syncytial virus or pertussis; and a sepsis workup, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. A brain CT may be included in cases of suspected nonaccidental trauma. There is no relation between ALTE/BRUE and sudden infant death syndrome, which are now considered distinct entities.

# ■ JAUNDICE

There are multiple causes of jaundice, and the likelihood of any specific cause is based on the age of onset. Jaundice that occurs within the first 24 hours of life tends to be serious in nature and usually is addressed while the

--- Page 384 ---

364 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

patient is in the newborn nursery. Jaundice that develops during the second or third day of life is usually physiologic; if the neonate is gaining weight, feeding and stooling well, is not anemic, does not have an elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin level greater than one-third the total, and does not have  a  total  bilirubin  level  indicating  the  need  for  phototherapy  (check www.bilitool.org) reassurance and close follow-up are appropriate. Jaundice that develops after the third day of life is generally serious. Causes include sepsis, UTI, congenital TORCH infections, hemolytic anemia, biliary  atresia,  breast  milk  jaundice,  and  hypothyroidism.  Workup  of  these infants usually includes a complete sepsis evaluation, including a lumbar puncture, a peripheral blood smear, complete blood count, total and direct bilirubin levels, liver function tests, reticulocyte count, and a Coombs test. Empiric antibiotics are generally administered when sepsis is suspected.

# ■ OrAL THrUSH AND DIApEr rASH

Intraoral lesions due to Candida are typically white and pasty and cover the tongue,  lips,  gingiva,  and  buccal  mucosa.  Treatment  consists  of  topical application of oral nystatin suspension four times a day.

Two main types of diaper rash are common in neonates: contact dermatitis and candidal diaper dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is macular, erythematous,  and  has  sharply  demarcated  edges.  Treatment  consists  of  frequent diaper  changes,  air  drying,  and  application  of  a  barrier  cream  containing zinc oxide. Candidal dermatitis presents with erythematous plaques with a scalloped border and satellite lesions. Treatment consists of frequent diaper changes and application of nystatin cream at least four times a day.

# ■ EYE COMpLAINTS

Red eyes in neonates run the spectrum from benign to sight threatening. A common benign finding is a corneal  abrasion  from  uncoordinated  hand movements and untrimmed fingernails in neonates. Fluorescein staining is diagnostic.  Cloudy  corneas  suggest  acute  glaucoma.  Prompt  pediatric ophthalmologic  consultation  is  indicated.  Conjunctivitis  in  the  neonatal period may be related to sexually transmitted infections. Gonococcal conjunctivitis typically occurs in the first few days of life and presents with copious discharge. In these cases, a sepsis workup, ocular irrigation, parenteral antibiotics, prompt ophthalmology consultation, and admission to the hospital are indicated. After the first week of life, chlamydial conjunctivitis is more common and may range from mild to severe. Topical drops are inadequate treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis. Oral erythromycin is indicated.

# ■ ABDOMINAL CATASTrOpHES

Surgically  correctable  abdominal  emergencies  in  neonates  are  uncommon,  may  present  with  nonspecific  symptomatology,  and,  when suspected,  require  prompt  consultation  with  an  experienced  pediatric surgeon.  Common signs and symptoms include irritability and crying, poor feeding, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention. Bilious vomiting is suggestive of malrotation with midgut volvulus and requires

--- Page 385 ---

CHAPTER 67: Common Neonatal Problems

365

emergent surgical consultation and radiologic evaluation (upper gastrointestinal  series  with  small  bowel  follow  through).  Projectile  vomiting following feeds suggests pyloric stenosis, which is evaluated with ultrasound.  A  groin  mass  may  represent  an  incarcerated  hernia;  inguinal hernias are common among premature infants.

# ■ INBOrN ErrOrS OF METABOLISM

Typical presentations of inborn errors of metabolism include lethargy or cardiorespiratory arrest. Most neonates will have inborn errors of metabolism diagnosed after successful resuscitation. Adding a properly obtained serum ammonia level to the usual laboratories obtained during resuscitation may assist in facilitating the diagnosis of some inborn errors of metabolism.

# ■ CONGENITAL ADrENAL HYpErpLASIA

These neonates present with virilization, ambiguous genitalia, and hyperpigmentation  and  may  be  in  shock  on  presentation.  Laboratory  values include hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. In addition to usual resuscitation measures,  hydrocortisone  administered  intravenously,  intramuscularly,  or intraosseously at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg is indicated.

# ■ CONGENITAL HEArT DISEASE AND CYANOSIS

Many disorders can present with cyanosis, and differentiating among them can be a diagnostic challenge. However, symptom patterns may help differentiate various causes and assist in suggesting the correct diagnosis and course of action. Rapid, unlabored respirations and cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen therapy suggest cyanotic heart disease with right-to-left shunting. Irregular or shallow breathing and cyanosis suggest sepsis, CNS disease,  or  metabolic  disorders.  Labored  breathing  with  grunting  and retractions is suggestive of pulmonary disease such as pneumonia or bronchiolitis.  All  cyanotic  neonates  should  be  admitted  to  the  hospital  for monitoring, therapy, and further investigation.

# ■ NONACCIDENTAL TrAUMA

A battered child may present with unexplained bruises at different ages, skull fractures, intracranial injuries identifiable on computed tomography of the head, extremity fractures, cigarette burns, retinal hemorrhages, unexplained irritability, lethargy, or coma.

This chapter is limited to infections of the ears,  nose,  neck,  and  throat. Further  information  can  be  found  in  Chapter  69  'Upper  Respiratory Emergencies-Stridor and Drooling,' as well as Chapter 151 'Ear, Nose and Sinus Emergencies' and Chapter 153 'Neck and Upper Airway Disorders.'

# ■ ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA

Acute  otitis  media  (AOM)  accounts  for  7.4%  of  all  visits  to  emergency departments in the United States. AOM is an infection of the middle ear space that commonly affects young children because of relative immaturity of the upper respiratory tract, especially the eustachian tube. The most common  pathogens  in  the  post-pneumococcal  vaccine  era  are Streptococcus pneumoniae (49%) and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (29%).

# Clinical Features

Peak age is 6 to 18 months. Symptoms include fever, poor feeding, irritability, vomiting, ear pulling, and earache. Signs include bulging, pus behind the tympanic  membrane (Fig.  68-1),  an  immobile  tympanic  membrane  (TM), loss of visualization of bony landmarks within the middle ear, and bullae on the  TM  (bullous  myringitis).  Mastoiditis  is  the  most  common  suppurative complication of AOM. The primary symptoms of mastoiditis include fever, protrusion of the auricle, and tenderness over the mastoid area.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Making an accurate diagnosis is the most important first step . The definition of AOM requires three equally important components: (a) acute onset ( < 48 hours) of signs and symptoms, (b) middle-ear effusion (see Fig. 68-1), and (c) signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. A red TM alone does not indicate the presence of an ear infection. Fever and prolonged crying can cause hyperemia of the TM alone. Pneumatic otoscopy can be a helpful diagnostic tool; however, a retracted drum for whatever reason will demonstrate decreased mobility. Other common causes of acute otalgia are a foreign body in the external ear canal or otitis externa.

state, ill-appearance, recent use of antibiotics, or the diagnosis of another bacterial infection. If any of these conditions are met, the child should be prescribed an immediate antibiotic.

--- Page 388 ---

368 SECTION 9:  Pediatrics

Uncomplicated AOM is treated  as  an  outpatient,  whereas  mastoiditis typically requires inpatient treatment.

# ■ OTITIS EXTErNA

Otitis externa (OE) is an inflammatory process involving the auricle, external auditory canal (EAC), and surface of the TM. It is commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus , which often coexist.

# Clinical Features

Peak seasons for OE are spring and summer, and the peak age is 7 to 12 years. Symptoms include earache, itching, and, less commonly, fever. Signs include erythema, edema of the EAC, white exudate on the EAC and TM, pain with motion of the tragus or auricle, and periauricular or cervical adenopathy.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis for OE is based on clinical signs and symptoms. A foreign body within  the  external  canal  should  be  excluded  by  carefully  removing  any debris that may be present.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Follow-up should be advised if improvement does not occur within 48 hours; otherwise routine follow-up is not necessary. Malignant OE is characterized by systemic symptoms and auricular cellulitis. This condition can result in serious complications and requires hospitalization with parenteral antibiotics.

# ■ ACUTE BACTErIAL SINUSITIS

Sinusitis is an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses that may be secondary to infection or allergy, and may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as an infection of the paranasal sinuses with complete  resolution  in < 30  days.  The  major  pathogens  in  childhood  are Streptococcus  pneumoniae , Moraxella  catarrhalis , and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.

# Clinical Features

Two  major  types  of  sinusitis  may  be  differentiated  on  clinical  grounds: acute severe sinusitis and mild subacute sinusitis. Acute severe sinusitis is

--- Page 389 ---

CHAPTER 68: Common Infections of the Ears, Nose, Neck, and Throat

369

associated  with  elevated  temperature,  headaches,  and  localized  swelling and tenderness or erythema in the facial area corresponding to the sinuses. Such localized findings are seen most often in older adolescents. Mild subacute sinusitis  is  manifest  in  childhood  as  a  protracted  upper  respiratory infection associated with purulent nasal discharge persisting in excess of two  weeks.  Fever  is  infrequent.  Chronic  sinusitis  may  be  confused  with allergies or upper respiratory infections.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds without laboratory or radiographic studies. Transillumination of the maxillary or frontal sinuses is seldom helpful. Nasal congestion lasting 3 to 7 days often accompanies viral upper respiratory infections and should not be diagnosed as acute sinusitis, nor treated with  antibiotics. Similarly , colored  drainage  from  the  nose  as  a  solitary symptom does not suggest a diagnosis of sinusitis and should not be treated with antibiotics .  Imaging  studies  are  not  needed  to  confirm  a  diagnosis  of acute bacterial sinusitis in children < 6 years of age with persistent symptoms.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Patients with mild symptoms suggestive of a viral infection can be observed for  7  to  10  days,  with  no  antibiotics  prescribed.  Suspect  acute  bacterial sinusitis  if  symptoms  persist  or  are  severe:  fever > 39°C,  purulent  nasal drainage for > 3 days and ill-appearance.

# ■ STOMATITIS AND phArYNGITIS

Herpangina, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and herpes simplex gingivostomatitis are the primary infections that cause stomatitis in children and are all viral. The vast majority of pharyngitis is caused by viral infections; however, group A β -hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are  bacterial  infections  that  require  accurate  diagnoses.  The identification and treatment of GABHS pharyngitis is important to prevent the suppurative complications and the sequelae of acute rheumatic fever.

# Clinical Features

Herpangina causes a vesicular enanthem of the tonsils and soft palate, affecting children 6 months to 10 years of age during late summer and early fall. The vesicles are painful and can be associated with fever and dysphagia. HFMD usually begins as macules which progress to vesicles of the palate, buccal  mucosa,  gingiva,  and  tongue.  Similar  lesions  may  present  on  the palms of hands, soles of feet, and buttocks. Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis often presents with abrupt onset of fever, irritability, and decreased oral

--- Page 390 ---

370 SECTION 9:  Pediatrics

intake  with  edematous  and  friable  gingiva.  Vesicular  lesions  often  with ulcerations are seen in the anterior oral cavity.

Peak seasons for GABHS are late winter or early spring, the peak age is 5 to 15 years, and it is rare before the age of 2 years. Symptoms include sore  throat,  fever,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  enlarged  anterior  cervical nodes, palatal petechiae, and hypertrophy of the tonsils. With GABHS there is usually the absence of cough, coryza, laryngitis, stridor, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea. A scarlatinaform rash associated with pharyngitis may indicate GABHS and is commonly referred to as scarlet fever .

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a herpes virus and often presents much like streptococcal pharyngitis. Common symptoms are fever, sore throat, and malaise.  Cervical  adenopathy  may  be  prominent  and  often  is  posterior. Hepatosplenomegaly and splenomegaly may be present. EBV should be suspected in the child with pharyngitis nonresponsive to antibiotics in the presence of a negative throat culture.

Gonococcal pharyngitis in children and nonsexually active adolescents should alert one to the possibility of sexual abuse. Gonococcal pharyngitis may be associated with infection elsewhere including proctitis, vaginitis, urethritis, or arthritis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnoses of herpangina, HFMD, and herpes simplex gingivostomatitis are based on clinical findings. To diagnose GABHS, current guidelines recommend the use of Centor criteria to determine which patients require testing: (a) tonsillar exudates, (b) tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, (c) absence of cough, and (d) history of fever. With two or more criteria, testing should be performed with a rapid antigen detection test and/or culture. If the rapid antigen test is negative, a confirmatory throat culture is recommended.

Diagnosis of EBV is often clinical. A heterophile antibody (monospot) can aid in the diagnosis. The monospot may be insensitive in children < 2 years of age and is often negative in the first week of illness. If obtained, the white blood cell count may show a lymphocytosis with a preponderance of atypical lymphocytes. Diagnosis of gonococcal pharyngitis is made by culture  on  Thayer-Martin  medium. Vaginal,  cervical,  urethral,  and  rectal cultures also should be obtained if gonococcal pharyngitis is suspected.

# ■ CErVICAL LYMphADENITIS

Acute, unilateral cervical lymphadenitis is commonly caused by S. aureus or group A Streptococcus . Bilateral cervical lymphadenitis is often caused by viral entities such as EBV and adenovirus. Chronic cervical lymphadenitis is less common but may be caused by Bartonella henselae or Mycobacterium species.

# Clinical Features

Acute cervical lymphadenitis presents with tender, > 1 cm nodes often with overlying erythema. Bilateral cervical lymphadenitis presents with small, rubbery lymph nodes and usually self-resolves. Bartonella results from the scratch of a kitten with ipsilateral cervical lymphadenitis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Most cases are diagnosed clinically, although culture may guide effective antimicrobial treatment. Differential may also include sialadenitis (infection of the salivary glands), which is usually caused by S. aureus , as well as gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most  cases  of  acute  bilateral  cervical  lymphadenitis  resolve  without antibiotics, as they often represent viral infection or reactive enlargement. Chronic cases of lymphadenitis are often treated surgically, with directed antimicrobial therapy in some cases depending on clinical diagnosis.

# ■ FUrThEr rEADING

--- Page 392 ---

The physical sign common to all causes of upper respiratory tract obstruction  is  stridor.  Laryngomalacia,  due  to  a  developmentally  weak  larynx, accounts for 60% of stridor in the neonatal period, but is self-limited and rarely requires treatment. Common causes of stridor in children > 6 months of age discussed here include viral croup, epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, airway foreign body, retropharyngeal abscess, and peritonsillar abscess.

# ■ VIRAL CROUP (LARYNGOTRACHEOBRONCHITIS)

Viral croup is responsible for most cases of stridor after the neonatal period. It is usually a benign, self-limited disease caused by edema and inflammation  of  the  subglottic  area.  Croup  is  most  prevalent  in  the  fall  and  early winter, and children ages 6 months to 3 years are most commonly affected, with a peak at an age of 12 to 24 months.

# Clinical Features

Croup typically begins with a 1- to 3-day prodrome of cough, coryza, and low-grade fever, followed by a 3- to 4-day period of classic barking cough, though cough and stridor may be abrupt in onset. Symptoms peak on days 3 to 4 and are often more severe at night. Physical examination classically shows stridor, with a greater inspiratory component. Severe cases may have stridor at rest, tachypnea, nasal flaring, and retractions.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of croup is clinical: a barking, seal-like cough and history or finding  of  stridor  in  the  appropriate  setting  is  diagnostic.  The  differential diagnosis includes epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, or foreign body aspiration. Radiographs are not necessary, unless other causes are being considered. Neck or chest radiographs may demonstrate subglottic narrowing or the 'steeple sign,' though this sign is neither sensitive nor specific for croup.

373

5 mL, can be used. Children with stridor associated only with agitation do not need epinephrine.

# ■ EPIGLOTTITIS

Epiglottitis, or supraglottitis, is life threatening and can occur at any age. Historically  caused  by Haemophilus  influenzae type  b,  vaccination  has decreased the occurrence of epiglottitis. In immunized children, most cases are caused by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. Candida may be a cause in immunocompromised patients.

# Clinical Features

Classically, there is abrupt onset of high fever, sore throat, and drooling. Symptoms may progress rapidly to stridor and respiratory distress. Cough may be absent and the voice muffled. The patient is toxic in appearance and may assume a tripod or sniffing position to maintain the airway. The presentation in older children and adults can be subtler. The only complaint may be severe sore throat, with or without stridor. The diagnosis is suggested by severe sore throat, a normal-appearing oropharynx, and a striking tenderness with gentle movement of the hyoid.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Radiographs are usually unnecessary to make the diagnosis in patients with a classic presentation. If the diagnosis is uncertain, then lateral neck films should be taken at the bedside in extension and during inspiration with a minimum of disturbance. If it is necessary for the patient to be moved to the radiology suite, a physician trained in airway management should be present at all times. The epiglottis is normally tall and thin, but in epiglottitis, it is  very  swollen  and  appears  squat  and  fat  like  a  thumbprint  (called  the 'thumb sign') at the base of the hypopharynx (Fig. 69-1). False-negative radiographic evaluations do occur, and, if suspicion remains, gentle direct visualization of the epiglottis is necessary to exclude the diagnosis. Blood cultures are positive in up to 90% of patients, whereas cultures from the epiglottis are less sensitive.

indicated. Multiple endotracheal tube sizes must be immediately available. For the patient who is able to maintain their airway, use of paralytics  must  be  accompanied  by  the  certainty  that  intubation  will  be successful or that a surgical airway can immediately be performed if unsuccessful.

# ■ BACTERIAL TRACHEITIS

Bacterial  tracheitis  (membranous  laryngotracheobronchitis  or  'bacterial croup')  is  uncommon  and  can  present  as  either  a  primary  or  secondary infection. The mean age of presentation is between 5 and 8 years of age, compared with younger ages as had been previously described. It is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae , or β -lactamase-producing  gram-negative  organisms  ( H.  influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis ).

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  bacterial  tracheitis  appear  toxic  and  have  more  respiratory distress than do patients with croup. They commonly present with sudden worsening of an upper respiratory infection with fever, sore throat, stridor, and cough occasionally productive of thick sputum.

# Diagnosis and Differential

If obtained, radiographs of the lateral neck and chest usually demonstrate subglottic narrowing of the trachea with irregular densities and ragged and indistinct borders. Bronchoscopy, however, is most diagnostic.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ AIRWAY FOREIGN BODY

Foreign body (FB) aspirations cause more than 3000 deaths each year and have a peak incidence between ages 1 and 3 years. In children younger than 6 months, the cause is usually secondary to a feeding by a well-meaning sibling. The most common FB aspirations fall into two groups: food and

--- Page 396 ---

376 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

toys. Commonly aspirated foods include peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, grapes, and hot dogs, but almost any object may be aspirated. Unlike small round metal objects, aspirated vegetable matter commonly causes intense pneumonitis and subsequent pneumonia and suppurative bronchitis. A FB aspiration  should  be  suspected  if  there  is  a  history  of  sudden  onset  of coughing or choking and should be considered in all children with unilateral wheezing.

# Clinical Features

At presentation many patients are asymptomatic. There may or may not be a witnessed aspiration. The primary symptom is cough, which is classically abrupt in onset, and may be associated with gagging, choking, stridor, or cyanosis.  Signs  depend  upon  the  location  of  the  FB  and  the  degree  of obstruction: stridor and hoarseness with a FB in the laryngotracheal area; unilateral  wheezing  and  decreased  breath  sounds  with  a  bronchial  FB. Symptoms, however, are unreliable in localizing the level of FB. Wheeze may be present in 30% of laryngotracheal FB aspirations and stridor in up to 10% of bronchial aspirations. Eighty to 90% of FBs are located in the bronchi. Patients with immediate onset of severe stridor and cardiac arrest usually have laryngotracheal aspirations.

# Diagnosis and Differential

FB aspiration is easily confused with more common causes of respiratory diseases because patients may have fever, wheezing, or rales. While plain chest radiographs may be  helpful to confirm a diagnosis, they can be normal in > 50% of tracheal FB and 25% of bronchial FB. More than 75% of FB  in  children < 3  years  of  age  are  radiolucent.  In  cases  of  complete obstruction, atelectasis may be found. In partial obstructions, a ball valve effect occurs, with air trapping caused by the FB leading to hyperinflation of the obstructed lung apparent during expiration. Thus, in a stable cooperative child, inspiratory and expiratory posteroanterior chest radiographs may be helpful. In a stable but noncooperative child, decubitus films may be used, but are less sensitive than fluoroscopy. FB aspiration is definitively diagnosed preoperatively in only one-third of cases; thus, if clinically suspected, bronchoscopy is indicated.

Upper esophageal FBs are usually radiopaque and can impinge on the posterior aspect of the trachea. Patients may present with stridor, and typically have dysphagia. Radiographically, flat FBs such as coins are usually oriented in the sagittal plane when located in the trachea and in the coronal plane when in the esophagus.

377

# ■ RETROPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS

Retropharyngeal abscesses form within a potential space present only in young children and usually occur in children younger than 4 years of age.

# Clinical Features

Patients classically present with fever, drooling, and dysphagia, and may have inspiratory stridor. Patients may hold their neck in an unusual position with  torticollis,  hyperextension,  or  stiffness.  Reported  complications include rapidly fatal airway obstruction from sudden rupture of the abscess pocket, aspiration pneumonia, empyema, mediastinitis, and erosion into the jugular vein and carotid artery.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Physical  examination  of  the  pharynx  may  show  a  retropharyngeal  mass. Although palpation commonly will demonstrate fluctuance, this could lead to rupture of the abscess. Lateral neck radiograph performed during inspiration  may  show  a  widened  retropharyngeal  space.  The  diagnosis  is  suggested when the retropharyngeal space at C2 is twice the diameter of the vertebral body or greater than one half the width of C4. CT of the neck with IV contrast is very helpful for diagnosis and defining extent of the infection and may help differentiate between cellulitis and abscess.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS

A peritonsillar abscess is a typically unilateral, deep, oropharyngeal polymicrobial infection, most commonly seen in adolescents and young adults.

# Clinical Features

Patients usually appear acutely ill with sore throat, fevers, chills, dysphagia/ odynophagia,  trismus,  drooling,  and  a  muffled  'hot  potato'  voice.  The uvula is displaced away from the affected side. As a rule, the affected tonsil is anteriorly and medially displaced.

--- Page 398 ---

378 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis and differentiation from aperitonsillar cellulitis can typically be made through careful visualization of the oral cavity. Classic findings include uvular deviation away from the abscess, soft palate displacement, trismus, and localized fluctuance; airway compromise may occur. In typical cases,  imaging  studies  are  unnecessary,  though  in  patients  with  toxic appearance  or  atypical  exam  findings,  computed  tomography  (CT)  with contrast or ultrasound is indicated.

# Wheezing in Infants and Children

70

Richard J. Scarfone

# ■ ASTHMA

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the most frequent  reason  for  hospitalization  of  children.  The  primary  pathologic event is airway inflammation causing recurrent episodes of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough associated with airflow obstruction that is variably reversible. The most common triggers are viral infections, allergens, exercise, and environmental irritants including cigarette smoke and cold air.

# Clinical Features

Wheezing, a high-pitched sound that occurs when there is an elevation of airway resistance, is the hallmark of an acute asthma exacerbation. Associated findings may include cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness or  pain.  To  optimize  medical  management,  clinical  features  are  used  to classify  severity  as  mild,  moderate,  or  severe.  In  addition  to  degree  of wheezing, the other important clinical features used to define illness severity include respiratory rate, work of breathing as indicated by retractions and/or  nasal  flaring,  aeration  quality,  and  inspiratory/expiratory  ratio. Serial  assessments  are  key  to  emergency  department  (ED)  management because changes in clinical status and response to treatment are usually more relevant to outcome and need for admission than the level of severity at presentation.

Hypoxemia, while frequent, is usually mild (SpO 2 > 92%) and due to V/Q mismatch, which may worsen during initial treatment with bronchodilators for a period of 1 to 2 hours. If available, end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ) by capnometry should be monitored during severe exacerbations. Hypocapnia is expected early in the course of an asthma exacerbation, thus a normal or minimally elevated ETCO 2 may be a sign of impending ventilatory failure.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  differential  diagnosis  of  wheezing  in  infants  and  children  is extensive-asthma  and  bronchiolitis  being  the  most  common  causes. Consideration of patient age, presenting signs and symptoms, response to therapy, and time of year helps differentiate the two diseases. For children > 2  years  old  who  do  not  have  a  prior  history  of  asthma,  a  provisional diagnosis  of  asthma  is  made  when  there  are  signs  and  symptoms  of wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea, diminished air entry, or retractions and demonstration of reversibility with an inhaled β 2 -agonist (e.g., albuterol). On the other hand, children < 2 years old without a prior history or family history of wheezing and presenting during a respiratory viral  epidemic  with  a  preceding  upper  respiratory  infection  should  be treated as having bronchiolitis.

Chest radiography should be considered if the patient fails to improve as expected, fever is present, there is concern for possible pneumothorax

(pain or significant hypoxia) or foreign body (unilateral wheezing), or for patients with focal lung findings.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

An inhaled β 2 -agonist, most often albuterol, is the mainstay of acute asthma therapy and its frequency of administration should be titrated to the child's degree of illness.

CHAPTER 70: Wheezing in Infants and Children

381

# ■ BRONCHIOLITIS

Bronchiolitis  is  the  most  frequent  lower  respiratory  infection  in  the  first 2 years of life and is most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infection causes acute airway inflammation and edema, small airway epithelial cell necrosis and sloughing, increased mucus production and mucus  plugs,  and  bronchospasm,  all  of  which  can  vary  considerably between patients and during the course of the illness.

# Clinical Features

Most patients have wheezing and rhinorrhea typical of an upper respiratory infection  (URI)  in  addition  to  some  combination  of  fever,  tachypnea, cough, rales, use of accessory muscles, and nasal flaring. Apnea and dehydration are of great concern and may be more common in infants younger than  3  months  or  those  born  prematurely.  Hypoxemia,  cyanosis,  altered mental status, and fatigue are ominous signs and may portend respiratory failure. Disposition decisions should be made with consideration of signs of severity as well as the typical time course for illness: severity increases over the first 3 to 5 days with total duration of illness 7 to 14 days.

--- Page 402 ---

382 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Diagnosis and Differential

Bronchiolitis,  like  asthma,  typically  has  wheezing  as  its  most  prominent clinical sign. In contrast to asthma, however, most infants with bronchiolitis are unresponsive to both β -agonists and corticosteroids. Thus, it is important to differentiate the two conditions. In general, patients with bronchiolitis are < 2 years old (peaking presentation is 6 to12 months of age), do not have a past history or family history of wheezing or atopic disease, have a URI,  and  present  during  a  RSV  or  other  respiratory  viral  pathogen  outbreak. Diagnosis is clinical and does not require laboratory or radiologic studies.

Routine testing for RSV or other pathogens is expensive and is rarely helpful; it may be indicated only if the information is necessary for infection  control  measures  for  hospitalized  patients.  Routine  performance  of radiographs increases inappropriate antibiotic use and does not change time to  recovery.  Radiographs  are  indicated  only  if  other  diseases  or  foreign body aspiration are suspected, or if the patient has severe disease.

Pneumonia, infection of the lower respiratory tract, is one of the leading causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The etiologic agent, clinical presentation, and severity of illness vary greatly based on the age of the child. In neonates (age 0 to 30 days), group B streptococci and other gram-negative enteric bacteria are common pathogens.  Pneumonia  caused  by Chlamydia  trachomatis has  largely  been eliminated  in  developed  countries,  but  should  be  considered  when  the mother had little or no prenatal care. In infants and toddlers (1 month to 2  years),  respiratory  syncytial  virus  (RSV),  influenza  virus,  parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus are some of the common viral pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial pathogens. Pneumonia in children aged 2 to 5 years is most likely caused by respiratory viruses, followed by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae ,  and Staphylococcus aureus .  In  children 5 to 13 years  of  age, Mycoplasma  pneumoniae is  the  most  likely  etiology  of community-acquired  pneumonia  followed  by S.  pneumoniae  and Chlamydophila pneumoniae . Adolescents typically follow the same seasonal  and  epidemiologic  patterns  of  healthy  adults  with  communityacquired pneumonia.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The clinical presentation of pneumonia varies with the age of the patient, although most pediatric patients will have some combination of fever, preceding viral illness, tachypnea, respiratory distress, rales, and diminished breath sounds. Tachypnea is the most sensitive finding in pediatric patients with pneumonia (see Table 71-1). Symptoms of pneumonia may be subtle in neonates and infants, but these patients may be more severely ill. Fever or  hypothermia,  apnea,  tachypnea,  poor  oral  intake,  vomiting,  lethargy, grunting, or shock may be present in these patients. In older children and teens,  community-acquired  pneumonia  presents  more  similarly  to  adult patients with a viral prodrome, fever, cough, abnormal lung sounds, vomiting,  pleuritic  chest  pain,  tachypnea,  or  hypoxemia.  In  younger  children, particularly  with  lower  lobe  pneumonias,  abdominal  pain  may  be  a

predominant complaint. The clinical manifestations of bacterial and viral pneumonias overlap in all age groups, making the clinical distinction very challenging.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

For most pneumonias, the etiologic agent is never determined. The diagnosis of pneumonia should primarily be made on clinical grounds; chest radiography  is  not  required  and  not  considered  the  gold  standard  for diagnosis. Chest radiography is not 100% sensitive, nor specific for the diagnosis  of  pneumonia,  and  does  not  distinguish  between  bacterial  or viral etiologies. The presence of fever plus tachypnea, decreased breath sounds, or fine crackles predicts pneumonia with 93% to 96% sensitivity. If all four variables are present, the sensitivity is 98%. Chest radiography should be reserved for patients in which the differential diagnosis is in question  (aspirated  foreign  body,  congestive  heart  failure,  mediastinal mass) or a complication of pneumonia is suspected (failure of outpatient therapy, pleural effusion, cavitary pneumonia, significant patient comorbidities, age < 3 months). Routine laboratory testing is not required for well-appearing children with mild community-acquired pneumonia. For neonates  or  older  patients  with  significant  respiratory  distress  or  toxic appearance,  a  blood  culture,  complete  blood  count,  and  serum  electrolytes  should  be  obtained.  Rapid  viral  antigen  testing  (if  available)  for RSV, influenza, and human metapneumovirus can be valuable if they are quick and specific, as results may negate the need for imaging, invasive testing, and antibiotic therapy.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

The ED care of pediatric pneumonia is age-dependent but follows the principles of supportive care of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, dehydration, and fever. Oxygen should be given for respiratory distress or oxygen saturations less than 92% on room air. Antipyretics should be administered for febrile patients and may resolve tachypnea associated with fever. Patients with wheezing should be given bronchodilators. Dehydration (caused by respiratory distress, increased insensible losses, and diminished oral intake associated with pneumonia) should be corrected with boluses of 20mL/kg of normal saline. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated for patients based on suspicion of bacterial pathogen, age of patient, and severity of illness (see Table 71-2).

Neonates with pneumonia have a significant risk for respiratory decompensation  and  should  be  admitted  and  monitored  closely.  Most  healthy infants ( > 3 months) and children with pneumonia can be treated as outpatients.  Criteria  utilized  to  determine  need  for  admission  include  work  of breathing (presence of significant tachypnea, retractions, grunting), hypoxemia, poor oral intake, persistent vomiting, dehydration, and social factors (access to follow-up medical care, inadequate family resources, inability to follow treatment plan). Pediatric intensive care consultation and admission should be considered for infants with severe respiratory distress, impending respiratory failure, or shock.

# Pediatric Heart Disease

Garth D. Meckler

There  are  six  common  clinical  presentations  of  pediatric  heart  disease: cyanosis, shock, congestive heart failure (CHF), pathologic murmur, hypertension,  and  syncope. Table  72-1  lists  the  most  common  lesions  in  each category. While cyanosis and shock typically appear in the first weeks of life and are often dramatic in their presentation, the symptoms of CHF may be subtle and include respiratory distress or feeding intolerance, which may be misdiagnosed as viral upper respiratory tract illness, especially in winter months. A high index of suspicion must therefore be maintained in order to make the correct diagnosis. This chapter focuses on conditions producing cardiovascular  symptoms  seen  in  the  emergency  department  (ED)  that require immediate recognition, therapeutic intervention, and prompt referral to a pediatric cardiologist.

The evaluation of an asymptomatic murmur is a nonemergent diagnostic workup that can be done on an outpatient basis. Innocent murmurs, often described as flow murmurs, are of low intensity, are brief, and occur during systole. In general, common pathologic murmurs in children are typically harsh,  holosystolic,  continuous,  or  diastolic  in  timing,  and  often  radiate.

They may be associated with abnormal pulses or symptoms such as syncope or CHF.

The  treatment  of  dysrhythmias  is  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  pediatric hypertension  is  discussed  in  Chapter  26,  and  syncope  is  discussed  in Chapter 78. Chest pain is usually of benign etiology in children, though may occasionally  represent  congenital  (e.g., Anomalous  Left  Coronary Artery  arising  from  Pulmonary  Artery,  ALCAPA)  or  acquired  (e.g., Kawasaki disease, myocarditis, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy) heart disease. Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy are covered in Chapter 24, chest pain and acute coronary syndrome in Chapters 17 and 18, and Kawasaki disease in Chapter 83.

# ■ CYaNOSIS aND ShOCK

Cardiac causes of cyanosis and shock typically present in the first 2 weeks of life and present in the critically ill neonate. The differential diagnosis, however, is broad at this age, and, in addition to congenital heart disease, the  clinician  should  consider  infection  (sepsis,  pneumonia),  metabolic disease (see Chapter 79), and nonaccidental trauma. For the neonate presenting  with  cyanosis,  the  hyperoxia  test  helps  differentiate  respiratory disease  from  cyanotic  congenital  heart  disease  (although  imperfectly). When placed on 100% oxygen, the infant with cyanotic congenital heart disease will fail to demonstrate an increase in Pao 2 or pulse oximetry, while those with respiratory causes will often respond with an improvement in Pao 2 or pulse oximetry.

# Clinical Features

Acral cyanosis (blue discoloration of the distal extremities) can be normal in the neonate, but central cyanosis (including the mucus membranes of the mouth) is the cardinal feature of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Appreciation of cyanosis in dark-skinned neonates may be difficult, and an accurate  set  of  vital  signs  including  preductal  and  postductal  pulse  oximetry (i.e., right upper extremity and either lower extremity) and four-extremity blood  pressures  are  essential.  Cyanosis  associated  with  a  heart  murmur strongly  suggests  congenital  heart  disease,  but  the  absence  of  a  murmur does  not  exclude  a  structural  heart  lesion.  The  cyanotic  infant  may  be tachypneic, as well, though the increased respiratory rate in cyanotic heart disease  is  often  effortless  and  shallow  unless  associated  with  congestive heart failure, which is rare in the first week of life.

Shock with or without cyanosis, especially during the first 2 weeks of life,  should alert the clinician to the possibility of ductal-dependent congenital  heart  disease  in  which  systemic  (shock)  or  pulmonary  (cyanosis) blood flow depends on patency of the fetal ductus arteriosis. Shock in the neonate is recognized by inspection of the patient's skin for pallor (or, more often, an 'ashen grey' appearance), mottling, cyanosis, and assessment of the mental status appropriate for age. Mental status changes include apathy, irritability, or frank lethargy. Tachycardia and tachypnea may be the initial signs  of  impending  cardiovascular  collapse.  Distal  pulses  should  be assessed  for  quality,  amplitude,  and  duration,  and  a  differential  between preductal (right brachial) and postductal (femoral) pulses or blood pressure is classic for ductal-dependent lesions such as coarctation of the aorta.

390 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Diagnosis and Differential

The workup for congenital heart disease begins with chest radiograph and electrocardiogram  (ECG)  with  pediatric  analysis.  Chest  radiographs  are assessed  for  heart  size,  shape,  and  pulmonary  blood  flow. An  abnormal right position of the aortic arch may be a clue to the diagnosis of congenital cardiac lesion. Increased pulmonary vascularity may be seen with significant left-to-right shunting or left-sided failure. Decreased pulmonary blood flow  is  seen  with  right-sided  outflow  lesions  such  as  pulmonic  stenosis. Cyanotic  heart  lesions  often  demonstrate  right  axis  deviation  and  right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG while left outflow obstruction (e.g., coarctation of the aorta) may show left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography is generally required to define the diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis for cyanosis or shock due to congenital heart disease typically includes cyanotic lesions: transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, and other forms of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or abnormalities of right heart formation. Acyanotic lesions that can present with shock include severe coarctation of the aorta, critical aortic stenosis, and hypoplastic left ventricle. It should be noted that cyanosis may accompany shock of any cause.

Transposition  of  the  great  vessels  represents  the  most  common  cyanotic defect presenting in the first week of life. This entity is easily missed due to the absence of cardiomegaly or murmur, unless there is a coexistent ventricular septal defect (VSD). Symptoms (before shock) include central cyanosis, increased respiratory rate, and/or feeding difficulty. There is usually a loud and single S2. Chest radiographs may show an 'egg on a string' shaped heart with a narrow mediastinum and increased pulmonary vascular  markings.  ECG  may  show  right-axis  deviation  and  right  ventricular hypertrophy.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease overall, and can present with cyanosis later in infancy or childhood. Physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur of VSD, a diamondshape murmur of pulmonary stenosis, and cyanosis. Cyanotic spells in the toddler may be relieved by squatting. Chest radiograph may show a bootshape heart with decreased pulmonary vascular markings or a right-sided aortic arch. The ECG often demonstrates right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation.

Hypercyanotic episodes, or 'tet spells,' may bring children with tetralogy of Fallot to the ED in dramatic fashion. Symptoms include paroxysmal dyspnea, labored respirations, increased cyanosis, and syncope. Episodes frequently follow exertion due to feeding, crying, or straining with stools and last from minutes to hours.

Left  ventricular  outflow  obstruction  syndromes  may  present  with shock, with or without cyanosis. Several congenital lesions fall into this category, but in all these disorders, systemic blood flow is dependent on a large contribution of shunted blood through a patent ductus arteriosus. When  the  ductus  closes,  infants  present  with  decreased  or  absent perfusion,  pallor  or  an  ashen  appearance,  hypotension,  tachypnea,  and severe lactic acidosis. Diminished lower extremity pulses and BP, particularly compared to right brachial pulse and BP, are classic for coarctation of the aorta.

# Clinical Features

Congestive heart failure  from  congenital  or  acquired  heart  disease  typically  presents  after  the  neonatal  period,  usually  in  the  second  or  third month  of  life  (congenital)  or  later  in  childhood  (acquired  causes).  The distinction between pneumonia and CHF in infants requires a high index of clinical suspicion and is often difficult. Pneumonia can cause a previously stable cardiac condition to decompensate; thus, both problems can present simultaneously. Presenting symptoms include poor feeding, diaphoresis,  irritability  or  lethargy  with  feeding,  weak  cry,  and,  in  severe cases, grunting, nasal flaring, and respiratory distress. Note that the early tachypnea of CHF in infants is typically 'effortless' and is the first manifestation of decompensation, followed by increased work of breathing and rales on examination.

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Diagnosis and Differential

Cardiomegaly evident on chest radiograph is universally present except in constrictive pericarditis. A cardiothoracic index greater than 0.6 on the PA chest  radiograph  is  abnormal. The  primary  radiographic  signs  of  cardiomegaly  on  the  lateral  chest  radiograph  are  an  abnormal  cardiothoracic index and lack of retrosternal air space due to the direct abutment of the heart against the sternum.

Once CHF is recognized, age-related categories simplify further differential  diagnosis  (Table  72-2).  Congenital  cardiac  causes  of  CHF  are best  categorized  by  age  of  onset.  Early-onset  CHF  is  associated  with ductal-dependent  lesions  such  as  coarctation  of  the  aorta  and  may  be abrupt in onset; persistent patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) may also present in the neonatal period with CHF. Rarely, sustained tachyarrhythmias may present with CHF in the neonatal period. By contrast, lesions that result in pulmonary overcirculation such as VSD or atrial septal defect (ASD) present with gradual development of failure in the second or third month of life.  Onset  of  CHF  after  age  3  months  usually  signifies  acquired  heart disease  such  as  cardiomyopathy  or  myocarditis.  The  exception  is  when pneumonia,  endocarditis,  or  another  complication  causes  a  congenital lesion to decompensate.

Cardiomyopathy presents with respiratory distress and feeding difficulties and is easily confused with upper respiratory tract infection. A pathologic gallop (S3 and or S4) is key to recognition. Rales and organomegaly are often present, and cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are noted on chest radiography.

Myocarditis is often preceded by a viral respiratory illness, presents with nonspecific symptoms, and is more common in school age children. Presenting symptoms include shortness of breath, vomiting, poor feeding,  lethargy,  and  fever.  Signs  of  poor  perfusion,  organomegaly,  and

tachypnea  and  tachycardia  are  common.  ECG  may  show  diffuse  ST changes, dysrhythmias, or ectopy, which is associated with an increased risk of sudden death; a prolonged QRS duration of > 120 ms is associated  with  poor  clinical  outcome.  Chest  radiograph  shows  cloudy  lung fields from inflammation or pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly with poor distal pulses and prolonged capillary refill, however, distinguish it from common pneumonia. Cardiac Troponin T is a highly sensitive, though nonspecific,  test  for  myocarditis  and  levels < 0.01  ng/mL  reliably exclude myocarditis.

Usually pericarditis presents with pleuritic and positional chest pain. Muffled  heart  sounds  and  a  friction  rub  may  be  present  on  physical examination. Cardiomegaly is seen on a chest radiograph. An echocardiogram is performed urgently to distinguish a pericardial effusion from dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and to determine the need for pericardiocentesis.

If an infant presents in pure right-sided CHF, the primary problem is most  likely  to  be  pulmonary,  such  as  cor  pulmonale.  In  early  stages, periorbital edema is often the first noticeable sign. This may progress to  hepatomegaly,  jugular  venous  distention,  peripheral  edema,  and anasarca.

# Vomiting and Diarrhea in Infants and Children

Stephen B. Freedman

Gastroenteritis is a major public health problem, accounting for up to 20% of all acute care outpatient visits to hospitals. Most children who come to the  emergency  department  because  of  vomiting  and/or  diarrhea  have  a self-limited viral disorder. Nevertheless, loss of water and electrolytes can lead to clinical dehydration and may result in hypovolemic shock or lifethreatening electrolyte disturbances.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The evaluation of the child's hydration status is the cornerstone to clinical management, regardless of whether the presenting complaint is vomiting  or  diarrhea  (Table  73-1).  Viral,  bacterial,  and  other  infectious organisms can cause gastroenteritis, and spread most commonly occurs by  the  fecal-to-oral  route.  Viral  pathogens  cause  disease  by  invading tissue and altering the intestine's ability to absorb water and electrolytes. Bacterial pathogens cause diarrhea by producing enterotoxins and cytotoxins  and  by  invading  the  intestine's  mucosal  absorptive  surface. Dysentery occurs when bacteria invade the mucosa of the terminal ileum and colon, producing diarrhea with blood, mucus, or pus. Table 73-2 lists common infectious agents, clinical features, and treatments of diarrhea in children. Infants are at greater risk for rapid dehydration and hypoglycemia, as they are with chronic illnesses, high-risk social situations, or malnutrition.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Acute gastroenteritis  is  a  clinical  diagnosis  that  is  characterized  by  the presence of three or more diarrheal stools in a 24-hour period, and may be accompanied  by  vomiting,  poorly  localized  abdominal  pain,  and  fever. Because  gastroenteritis-induced  dehydration  is  usually  isotonic,  serum electrolytes are not routinely helpful unless signs of severe dehydration are  present  or  intravenous  rehydration  fluids  will  be  administered.

exception  is  infants  in  the  first  6  months  of  life,  in  whom  significant sodium abnormalities may develop. Bedside glucose should be checked in all patients with altered mental status; hypoglycemia can develop rapidly in the setting of protracted vomiting or diarrhea in infants and toddlers. Stool cultures are reserved for cases in which the child has traveled to a high-risk  country,  is  highly  or  persistently  febrile,  has  had  more  than 10 stools in the previous 24 hours, or has blood in the stool. In the setting of a known outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7, consider stool cultures and  blood  tests  to  check  for  evidence  of  hemolysis,  thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.

Although diarrhea is the most prominent symptom of acute gastroenteritis in infants and children, other etiologies of diarrhea that may result in significant morbidity must be considered: bacterial colitis, Hirschsprung disease, partial obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Acute appendicitis typically manifests with abdominal pain followed by vomiting associated with constipation; however, it may also  cause  diarrhea,  particularly  once  the  appendix  has  perforated  (see Chapter 74, 'Pediatric Abdominal Emergencies').

Vomiting  is  also  a  common  and  nonspecific  presentation  for  other disease  processes,  such  as  otitis  media,  urinary  tract  infection,  sepsis, malrotation,  intussusception,  increased  intracranial  pressure,  metabolic acidosis, and drug or toxin ingestions. Consequently, isolated vomiting , though most often of viral origin, requires a careful and thoughtful evaluation  before  being  diagnosed  as  acute  gastroenteritis.  Specific  clinical findings, such as bilious or bloody vomitus, hematochezia, or abdominal pain, should trigger concerns for a disease process other than simple viral gastroenteritis.

# ■ ABDOMINAL PAIN

The assessment of acute abdominal pain can be challenging given the preverbal state of young children, the varied number of diagnoses that present similarly,  and  increasing  appreciation  of  risks  associated  with  pediatric diagnostic imaging.

# Clinical Features

Presenting signs and symptoms differ by age. The key gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms include pain, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, jaundice, and masses. Abdominal pain in children younger than 2 years typically manifests as fussiness, irritability, lethargy, or grunting. Toddlers and school-age children often localize pain poorly and point to their umbilicus, or may present as refusal to ambulate. Pain may be peritoneal and exacerbated  by  motion,  or  spasmodic,  and  associated  with  restlessness. Abdominal pain may originate from non-GI sources, and associated symptoms  may  help  localize  extra-abdominal  causes  such  as  cough  with pneumonia or sore throat in streptococcal pharyngitis.

Vomiting and diarrhea are common in children. These symptoms may be the result of a benign process or indicate the presence of a life-threatening  condition.  Bilious  vomiting  is  almost  always  indicative  of  a  serious process, especially in the neonate. Upper GI bleeding in children presents with hematemesis, which is often frightening to caretakers, but rarely serious  in  an  otherwise  healthy  infant  or  child.  Lower  GI  bleeding  presents with  melena  or  hematochezia,  and  the  distinction  between  painless  and painful rectal bleeding can help differentiate likely etiologies. Jaundice can be an ominous sign, and sepsis, congenital infections, hepatitis, anatomic problems, and enzyme deficiencies should be considered in the evaluation of  these  patients. Abdominal  masses  may  be  asymptomatic  (e.g., Wilms tumor)  or  associated  with  painless  vomiting  (e.g.,  pyloric  stenosis)  or colicky abdominal pain (e.g., intussusception).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Obtain a thorough history from parent and child (if possible), including the quality and location of pain, chronology of events, feedings, bowel habits, fever, weight changes, and other systemic signs and symptoms. Begin the physical examination with an assessment of the child's overall appearance, vital signs, and hydration status. Observation should precede auscultation and palpation. Extra-abdominal areas including the chest, pharynx, testes, scrotum,  inguinal  area,  and  neck  should  also  be  evaluated.  Adolescent females who are sexually active with lower abdominal pain may require a bimanual  exam.  The  likely  etiologies  of  abdominal  pain  vary  with  age. Table 74-1 classifies emergent and nonemergent conditions by age group.

# Neonates and Young Infants (0 to 3 Months)

Life-threatening abdominal conditions in young infants include necrotizing enterocolitis, malrotation with midgut volvulus, incarcerated hernias, and nonaccidental trauma. Other urgent conditions include pyloric stenosis and testicular  torsion.  Inconsolability,  lethargy,  and  poor  feeding  may  be  the only indication of serious underlying disease. Bilious vomiting in an infant indicates intestinal obstruction and should be considered a surgical emergency  until  proven  otherwise.  Common  non-life-threatening  causes  of abdominal  pain  in  young  infants  include  colic  (see  Chapter  67)  milkprotein allergy or gastroesophageal reflux. Fever requires thorough investigation for a source (see Chapter 66). Other causes of irritability in infants should be considered, including hair or thread tourniquets of the digits and genitalia, and corneal abrasions (see Chapter 67).

Helpful  studies  in  this  age  group  include  abdominal  two-view  radiographs to identify obstruction, pneumatosis intestinalis, or free air; abdominal ultrasound to diagnose pyloric stenosis, testicular torsion, and hernias; and  upper  GI  contrast  studies  to  identify  malrotation.  Useful  laboratory studies include serum electrolytes to identify abnormalities resulting from vomiting  and  dehydration  and  a  CBC,  coagulation  panel,  and  type  and screen if concern is for a surgical abdomen with perforation.

Malrotation of the intestine can present with life-threatening volvulus . Symptoms include bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and obstipation,

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

or, occasionally, streaks of blood in the stool. The vast majority of cases present within the first month of life. Patients are ill-appearing and may present in compensated or decompensated shock. A 'bird's beak' appearance  on  an  upper  GI  series  is  suggestive  of  this  diagnosis.  Immediate surgical  consultation  and  aggressive  fluid  resuscitation  are  critical  to improve outcomes.

Pyloric stenosis usually presents with progressive nonbilious, projectile vomiting occurring just after feeding. Pyloric stenosis occurs most commonly in the third or fourth week of life, but may be seen anywhere from 1 to 12 weeks of age. A left upper quadrant pyloric mass, or 'olive,' may be present, but is usually difficult to detect, and peristaltic waves may be noted following a feeding trial in the ED. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice. Electrolytes may demonstrate a characteristic hypochloremic metabolic  alkalosis,  which  must  be  corrected  prior  to  definitive  surgical care. While pyloric stenosis is not a surgical emergency, the resultant dehydration from persistent vomiting requires immediate medical treatment.

Necrotizing  enterocolitis, although  rare  outside  of  the  neonatal  unit, should be considered in any infant younger than 3 weeks of age, especially if  premature.  V omiting,  poor  feeding,  and  abdominal  distention  may  be present, and abdominal films may show pneumatosis intestinalis, as well as portal  vein  gas.  Immediate  surgical/neonatology  consultation,  NPO,  IVF hydration,  and  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  for  intestinal  flora  should  be instituted if suspected.

Hirschsprung's disease is  a  pathologic  cause  of  constipation  in  this age group, as true constipation is unusual. Key history for Hirschprung's disease is delayed passage of meconium at birth (more than 24 hours). Symptoms  include  infrequent  and  often  explosive  bowel  movements, poor  feeding  and  growth,  and  progressive  abdominal  distension.  Toxic megacolon may occur as a complication and if suspected, emergent surgical consultation is warranted.

# Older Infants and Toddlers (3 Months to 3 Years)

The  differential  diagnosis  of  acute  abdominal  pain  in  this  age  group includes  intussusception,  gastroenteritis  (see  Chapter  73),  constipation, urinary tract disease (see Chapter 75), and nonaccidental trauma. Though less common in this age group, acute appendicitis, diabetic ketoacidosis or other metabolic diseases, tumors such as Wilm's, neuroblastoma or hepatoblastoma and malrotation with midgut volvulus must be considered.

Imaging  studies  are  guided  by  the  differential  diagnosis:  radiographs can help rule out free air or obstruction, and confirm suspected constipation; ultrasound can help identify intussusception, abdominal or renal mass, or appendicitis, and air-contrast enema is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic for intussusception. A CBC and electrolytes may be helpful in evaluating  complications  of  vomiting  and  diarrhea,  and  urinalysis  will identify pyelonephritis as a potential cause of abdominal pain in this age group. A bedside glucose is helpful in the lethargic child or in cases with persistent or prolonged vomiting.

Intussusception occurs when one portion of the bowel telescopes into another, which can result in a partial or complete obstruction, bowel-wall edema,  and  eventually  bowel  ischemia.  The  greatest  incidence  occurs between  6  to  18  months  of  age,  and  it  is  the  most  common  cause  of

intestinal obstruction in children under 2 years of age. The classic presentation of intermittent paroxysms of abdominal pain with pain-free intervals (or lethargy), vomiting (may be bilious), and 'currant jelly stool' are not present in all patients, and bloody stools is a late sign. Stool testing may reveal occult blood in 70% of intussusception cases. Providers must have a high index of suspicion for intussusception in patients presenting with nonspecific  changes  in  mental  status  or  who  are  ill-appearing  without  any apparent  etiology.  Ultrasound  should  be  performed  if  the  diagnosis  is ambiguous, and may demonstrate the classic 'target sign' (see Fig. 74-1). In more classic cases, air or barium enema should be performed, and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Radiologic reduction requires a readily available pediatric surgeon for irreducible cases or perforation during the procedure.  Uncomplicated  cases  of  intussusception  successfully  reduced by enema may be discharged after observation if tolerating oral fluids and has reliable follow-up, as there is a 10% recurrence risk.

Constipation ,  defined as infrequent, hard stools, is a common cause of abdominal pain in children and may be a sign of either a pathologic (e.g., Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, spinal cord abnormality, or infant botulism) or functional process. History is key to the diagnosis. For neonates, verify passage of meconium in the first 24 hours of life. A rectal examination is recommended to assess presence of stool, rectal tone, sensation, and size of the anal vault. A careful neurologic examination should be completed to assess for neuromuscular causes. A single upright abdominal radiograph may be helpful to visualize fecal retention or impaction, and to help rule out the concern for obstruction. Treatment in the ED with suppositories or enemas may be necessary, and outpatient maintenance therapy such as with polyethylene glycol for older children (older than 12 months) is essential to prevent recurrence. Admission  is  indicated  for  patients  with  impaction  associated with vomiting, dehydration, and failure of outpatient treatment.

# Children (3 to 15 Years Old)

Acute abdominal pain in children  3  to  15  years  old  includes  a  range  of diagnoses, including appendicitis (Chapter 43), constipation, gastroenteritis,

--- Page 424 ---

404

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

urinary tract infection, streptococcal pharyngitis (Chapter 68), pneumonia (Chapter 71), pancreatitis (Chapter 42), and functional abdominal pain. In adolescents, gall bladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic, or cholecystitis), renal stones, ovarian pathology (cysts or torsion), and testicular torsion  should  be  considered.  Diabetes  and  diabetic  ketoacidosis  are  more prevalent in this age group and commonly present as vague abdominal pain. The presence of a parent and allowing the child to sit on the parents' lap are helpful in examining younger children. Older children may not readily offer important history surrounding embarrassing topics such as constipation and genital pain. Adolescents should be interviewed alone to provide confidentiality  and  facilitate  discussion  of  potentially  important  information  surrounding sexual activity and other sensitive subjects.

Henoch -Schönlein purpura (HSP) is an idiopathic vasculitis of children between  2  and  11  years  of  age.  HSP  classically  presents  with  palpable purpura,  acute  abdominal  pain,  and  arthritis.  A  urinalysis  should  be obtained to identify hematuria, with subsequent renal function tests when blood  is  present,  as  up  to  30%  of  children  with  HSP  will  develop  renal involvement, sometimes months later. Abdominal pain in HSP is caused by bowel wall edema and GI vasculitis, and may occur before typical rash of HSP appears. Microscopic and even gross GI bleeding is not uncommon, though rarely life-threatening. Intussusception (ileo-ileo as compared to the classic ileo-colic in idiopathic intussception) occurs in 3.5%, and must be considered in patients with significant abdominal pain. Treatment of HSP is  primarily  supportive:  joint  pain  responds  well  to  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory medications; severe abdominal pain may improve with corticosteroids. Consultation and follow-up with a pediatric rheumatologist or nephrologist may be necessary for more severe symptoms or renal involvement with hypertension.

# ■ GAStrOINteStINAL BLeeDING

Upper GI (UGI) bleeding is distinguished from lower GI (LGI) bleeding anatomically at the ligament of Treitz. The presentation of GI bleeding in children varies, and includes bright red blood in small strands or clots in emesis or stool, vomiting of gross blood (hematemesis), black tarry stools (melena),  or  profuse  bright  red  blood  per  rectum.  Occult  bleeding  may present with pallor, fatigue, or anemia.

The first step in management is to evaluate the need for acute resuscitation, and distinguish the bleed as UGI or LGI. Confirmation through gastric or fecal occult blood testing is useful to distinguish substances that grossly mimic  blood.  Foods  such  as  beets,  cranberries,  and  red  food  dyes  can appear like blood in stool. A thorough history and physical examination is important  to  determine  the  location,  amount,  and  etiology  of  the  bleed. Examination for extra-GI sources is also important (e.g., epistaxis is a common cause of hematemesis in children). Ask about recent dental surgery or gingival bleeding. Post-tonsillectomy bleeding is an important and potentially serious cause of hematemesis. A common cause of hematemesis in the  newborn  is  swallowed  maternal  blood  (either  post-delivery  or  from fissures in mother's nipples).

The differential  diagnosis  of  UGI  and  LGI  bleeding  by  age  group  is summarized in Table 74-2. In general, UGI bleeding in children without

underlying portal hypertension is rarely life-threatening. While most causes of  LGI  bleeding  in  children  are  also  benign,  potential  emergent  causes include vascular malformations, Meckel diverticula, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and intussusception. In cases of melena, evaluate for causes of UGI bleeding and HSP. In cases of bright red blood per rectum, evaluate for anal fissure. For painless hematochezia, consider Meckel diverticulum, or arteriovenous  malformation.  For  hematochezia  in  the  setting  of  abdominal pain, the differential is larger including HSP, hemolytic uremic syndrome, infectious gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, milk-protein allergy in infants, intussusception, and necrotizing enterocolitis (neonates).

Laboratory  studies  and  imaging  should  be  completed  as  dictated  by other associated signs and symptoms. Mild bleeding can typically be managed  by  a  consultant  on  an  outpatient  basis.  Stool  studies  for  infectious causes should be sent if suspected. Moderate and severe bleeding requires acute  resuscitation  with  isotonic  crystalloid  and,  potentially,  blood  products. While acute shock should be treated immediately, overexpansion of intravascular volume should be avoided, particularly for variceal bleeding or more chronic conditions. Consultation with a pediatric surgeon, gastroenterologist, or critical care physician may be necessary, depending on the etiology.

# Pediatric Urinary Tract Infections

Marie Waterhouse

Urinary  tract  infections  (UTIs)  are  relatively  common  in  children,  from infancy  through  adolescence.  The  incidence  and  clinical  presentation  of pediatric UTI vary by age and gender.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

There  are  several  age-specific  clinical  presentations  for  pediatric  UTI. Neonates present with a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from sepsis, and may often have nonspecific symptoms such as fever, jaundice, poor feeding, vomiting, irritability, or lethargy. Older infants and young children typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, or decreased appetite. School-age children and adolescents present similarly to adults, and often, but not always, complain of specific urinary  symptoms  such  as  dysuria,  frequency,  urgency,  or  hesitancy. Infants and young children are more likely to have fever and upper tract disease, necessitating longer courses of antibiotic treatment. Adolescents without fever, flank pain, or vomiting may be treated similarly to adults with shorter course antibiotic regimens.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The gold standard  for  the  diagnosis  of  pediatric  UTI  is  the  growth  of  a single urinary pathogen from a properly obtained urine culture. For infants and children in diapers, urine obtained by sterile transurethral catheterization  is  preferred.  Ultrasound-guided  suprapubic  bladder  aspiration  is  an acceptable alternative, but is more invasive and rarely performed. For toilettrained children who can void on command (usually ascertained by asking a parent, but generally at around 3 years old), urine may be collected as a clean  catch  specimen.  Bagged  urine  specimens  have  virtually  no  role  in diagnosis of pediatric UTI, and are never appropriate for urine culture.

Urine microscopy and chemical test strips (dipstick) have similar test characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, dipstick is usually  faster  and  more  convenient,  and  a  finding  of  positive  nitrites  is highly specific for the presence of gram-negative bacteriuria, obviating the need for urine microscopy. In cases where dipstick is indeterminate (i.e., 'trace' leukocyte esterase), subsequent urine microscopy may be helpful in increasing diagnostic certainty. Microscopy is typically considered positive if more than five white blood cells per high-power field or bacteria are seen. Because young infants void frequently, and often do not store urine in the bladder long enough to accumulate leukocytes or nitrites, urinalysis is less sensitive in this age group, and culture should be sent regardless of negative urinalysis result.

Young children may also experience urinary symptoms from urethritis secondary to irritant soaps, clothing, or poor hygiene. Physical exam should assess  for  vaginitis  in  girls,  or  meatitis  or  balanitis  in  boys. Adolescents

407

408

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

may have urinary symptoms as a manifestation of a sexually transmitted disease  such  as Chlamydia  trachomatis .  An  appropriate  sexual  history should be obtained in teenagers, and a pelvic examination may be indicated for  sexually  active  females  (for  a  discussion  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases, see Chapter 87).

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The treatment and disposition of infants and children with UTI depend on age and clinical severity. In general, antibiotics should not be given until after urine culture has been obtained. However, timely antibiotic administration takes precedence in the septic patient.

The  causes  and  manifestations  of  seizures  are  numerous,  ranging  from benign to life threatening. Seizure precipitants include fever, CNS infections, head injury, structural brain abnormalities, hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxemia, toxin exposure, dysrhythmias, metabolic disorders, congenital infections, and neurocutaneous syndromes.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The clinical features of seizure activity depend on the affected area of the brain and can range from classic tonic-clonic movements to subtle behavioral  changes;  they  may  be  generalized  (with  loss  of  consciousness)  or partial (with focal motor or behavioral features). Rhythmic repetitive movements, bowel or bladder incontinence, a postictal state, and tongue biting are highly suggestive of seizures.

Motor changes (tonic or clonic) may be focal or generalized, and seizures may present with atony (sudden loss of tone or 'drop attack') in some age  groups.  Additional  seizure  manifestations  include  staring  spells ('absence') or changes in mental status or behavior, which can be complex, such as automatisms (blinking, bicycling, or lip smacking in infants), vocalizations, or hallucinations.

Associated clinical signs include alteration in autonomic dysfunction, such as mydriasis, diaphoresis, tachypnea or apnea, tachycardia, hypertension and salivation, and postictal somnolence. Transient focal deficits may represent Todd's paralysis following a seizure.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The diagnosis of seizure disorder is based primarily on history and physical examination. Bedside glucose testing should be performed on all children who are seizing or postictal, but the clinical scenario should direct additional laboratory and imaging tests. Screening tests for electrolytes are not indicated in most cases of childhood seizures including simple febrile seizures or first time afebrile seizures, unless otherwise indicated by the specific  history. The  suggested  ED evaluation of differing clinical scenarios presenting with seizures is listed in Table 76-1.

Status epilepticus is defined as seizure activity lasting > 30 minutes or multiple seizures without a return to normal mental status between seizures. Five  minutes  have  been  suggested  as  an  operational  definition  because seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes usually do not resolve without treatment. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency, and is more responsive to medications when treated early and aggressively.

Seizures must be distinguished from other events that masquerade as seizures in children such as syncope, breath-holding spells, gastroesophageal  reflux  (Sandifer's  syndrome),  chorea  (acute  rheumatic  fever), myoclonic  jerks,  rigors,  startle  reflex,  tics,  pseudo-seizures,  migraine

over  20  minutes; valproic  acid 20  mg/kg  IV/IO;  and levetiracetam 20 to 30 mg/kg IV/IO.

# Febrile Seizure

Seizures  in  the  setting  of  fever  are  common  in  children  and  are  usually benign. Simple febrile seizures (SFS) occur between 6 months and 6 years of life, are brief ( < 15 minutes), and generalized. Patients with SFS require no specific ED evaluation or medication for their seizure, though evaluation for a treatable source of fever such as a urinary tract infection, and antipyretics may be indicated. Children experiencing SFS have the same 1% risk  of  developing  epilepsy  as  the  general  population.  Complex  febrile seizures  ( > 15  minutes  in  duration,  focal,  or  recurrent)  carry  a  slightly higher risk for epilepsy, but also do not routinely require ED evaluation or treatment. Febrile status epilepticus is treated as above with the addition of neuroimaging, CSF analysis and culture, and potential antibiotics and acyclovir as indicated.

# First Seizure

The overall risk of recurrence after a single afebrile seizure is about 40%. Emergent neuroimaging is not necessary in the ED in the patient with a normal neurologic exam, though outpatient MRI and EEG may be of benefit. Most neurologists do not recommend starting anticonvulsant medication after a first seizure.

# ■ HEADACHE

Pediatric headache accounts for 1% of emergency department visits. The vast majority of headaches in children have a benign etiology. Factors associated with serious or dangerous causes of headache include preschool age, occipital  location,  recent  onset  of  headache,  and  inability  of  the  child  to describe the quality of the head pain.

# Clinical Features

Headaches can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary headaches are associated with normal physical exam findings, are self-limited, and may be recurrent. Examples of primary headache include physiologic or functional (migraine, tension, cluster). Secondary headaches are usually anatomic (vascular malformation, tumor) or infectious (sinusitis, dental abscess),  and  have  higher  morbidity  and  mortality  if  left  untreated. A careful history and physical examination should focus on identifying or excluding secondary headaches. Historical findings that suggest secondary headache include acute onset; associated fever or stiff neck; morning vomiting; behavioral changes; altered mental status; 'worst ever' headache; sleep disturbance; associated trauma or toxic exposure; or aggravation by coughing, Valsalva, or lying down. Physical findings suggestive of  secondary  headaches  include  blood  pressure  abnormalities,  nuchal rigidity, head tilt, ptosis, retinal hemorrhage or papilledema, visual field defects,  and  neurologic  findings  (altered  mental  status,  ataxia,  and hemiparesis).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Pertinent historical features of pediatric headache include severity and quality of pain, age of first occurrence, precipitants, rapidity of onset, location,  duration,  and  associated  symptoms.  Physical  examination should include a thorough general examination with careful attention to the neurologic examination, including cranial nerves, gait, strength, and mental status. The history and physical exam should guide the work up. For instance, CT is indicated to rule out suspected intracranial hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging better visualizes the posterior fossa, the most common location of pediatric brain tumors, and either modality  may  be  used  for  space-occupying  lesions  elsewhere. Importantly, neuroimaging  in  children  is  usually  not  indicated  unless  there  is  an abnormal neurologic exam, altered mental status, concurrent seizures, a  recent  'worst  headache  of  life'  complaint,  or  change  in  type  of headache .

# ■ ALtERED MENtAL StAtUS

Altered mental status (AMS) in a child is defined as the failure to respond to the external environment in a manner consistent with the child's developmental  level.  In  treating  children  with AMS,  aggressive  resuscitation, stabilization,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  must  occur  simultaneously  to  prevent morbidity and death.

# Clinical Features

The spectrum of AMS ranges from confusion to lethargy, stupor, and coma indicative of depression of the cerebral cortex or localized abnormalities of the  reticular  activating  system.  Important  historical  elements  to  consider include prodromal events (recent illnesses, exposures, trauma), risk factors (medications, social or family history, potential for abuse), and other associated  symptoms.  A  head-to-toe  exam  should  be  performed  to  identify occult  infection,  trauma,  toxicity,  or  metabolic  disease. A  child's  mental status can be assessed by the Glasgow coma scale, or the simpler AVPU scale,  where A means 'alert,' V means 'responsive to verbal stimuli,' P means 'responsive to painful stimuli,' and U means 'unresponsive,' corresponding to a GCS of 15, 13, 8, and 3, respectively.

Pathologic causes of altered mental status can be divided into supratentorial  lesions,  subtentorial  lesions,  and  metabolic  encephalopathy. Supratentorial lesions are due to compression of the brainstem, resulting

--- Page 434 ---

414

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

in  altered  level  of  consciousness  and  focal  motor  abnormalities  with  a rostral-to-caudal progression of dysfunction, and fast component of nystagmus away from the stimulus during cold caloric testing. Subtentorial lesions produce rapid loss of consciousness, cranial nerve abnormalities, abnormal  breathing  patterns,  asymmetric  or  fixed  pupils,  and  no  eye movement  during  cold  caloric  testing.  Metabolic  encephalopathy  produces  decreased  level  of  consciousness  before  exhibiting  motor  signs, which  are  symmetrical  when  present.  Pupillary  reflexes  are  intact  in metabolic encephalopathy except with profound anoxia, opiates, barbiturates, and anticholinergics.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A thorough history and physical examination are paramount to determining the diagnosis. The familiar mnemonic AEIOU TIPS (alcohol, encephalopathy, insulin, opiates, uremia, trauma, infection, poisoning, and seizure) is helpful in organizing diagnostic possibilities (Table 77-1).

# AEIOU tIpS: A Mnemonic for pediatric Altered Mental Status (Continued)

Tumor. Primary, metastatic, or meningeal leukemic infiltration. Intracerebral tumors commonly produce focal neurologic signs, and posterior fossa tumors typically block the ventricular system and create signs and symptoms suggestive of hydrocephalus. Supratentorial and infratentorial tumors may present abruptly with altered mental status, fever, or meningismus after an intratumor hemorrhage.

Thermal. Hypo- or hyperthermia. Progressive hypothermia leads to insidious altered mental status. Temperatures > 41°C (105.8°F) result in headache, weakness, and dizziness followed by confusion, euphoria, combativeness, and altered mental status.

Intracerebral vascular disorders. Subarachnoid, intracerebral, or intraventricular hemorrhages can be seen with trauma, ruptured aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformations. Venous thrombosis can follow severe dehydration or pyogenic infection of the mastoid, orbit, middle ear, or sinuses. Arterial thrombosis is uncommon in children, except in those with homocystinuria. Intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhages may follow birth asphyxia or trauma in neonates, but in older children, they may signify a congenital or acquired coagulopathy. Cerebral emboli from bacterial endocarditis may cause altered mental status. Acute confusional migraine may be associated with profound alterations in consciousness. Children with sickle cell anemia can develop cerebral thrombosis, status epilepticus, and coma.

Poisoning/ingestion. Drugs, toxins, or illicit substances can be ingested by accident, through neglect or abuse, or in a suicidal gesture.

Abbreviation: AMS, altered mental status.

Diagnostic adjuncts largely depend on the clinical situation and must be determined  immediately  after  the  primary  and  secondary  survey.  Rapid bedside glucose determination can immediately confirm either hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia due to diabetic ketoacidosis. Toxicity due to poisoning or ingestion may require a reversal agent. If meningitis or encephalitis

is  suspected,  lumbar  puncture  should  be  done  immediately  after  initial resuscitation and stabilization. Neuroimaging may be indicated in the setting of trauma or suspicion of space-occupying lesion.

# Syncope and Sudden Death in Children and Adolescents

Derya Caglar

Syncope is a presenting symptom for 1% to 3% of all pediatric emergency visits. It is more common in adolescents than younger children. Up to 50% of adolescents experience at least one syncopal episode which is usually transient and self-limited, but can be a symptom of serious cardiac disease.

Sudden, unexpected death in children comprises 2.3% of all pediatric deaths, of which sudden cardiac death makes up about one-third. The risk of sudden cardiac death is greater in patients with congenital or acquired heart disease, even those that have undergone corrective surgery. Except for trauma, sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of sports-related deaths. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital artery anomalies are the  most  common  cause  of  sudden  cardiac  death  in  adolescents  without known cardiac disease. Other causes of sudden cardiac death in children include myocarditis, congenital heart disease, and conduction disturbances.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Syncope is the sudden onset of falling accompanied by a brief episode of  loss  of  consciousness.  Involuntary  motor  movements  may  occur with all types of syncopal episodes but are most common with seizures. Table 78-1 lists the most common causes of syncope by category.

Neurally mediated syncope is the most common cause in children. This type of syncope typically lasts < 1 minute and is preceded by sensations of nausea, warmth, or light-headedness with a gradual visual grayout. Cardiac syncope  occurs  when  there  is  an  interruption  of  cardiac  output  from  an intrinsic  problem  such  as  tachydysrhythmia,  bradydysrhythmia,  outflow obstruction, and myocardial dysfunction. Syncope resulting from cardiac causes usually begins and ends abruptly and may be associated with chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. Risk factors associated with serious causes of syncope are presented in Table 78-2. Events easily mistaken for syncope are presented in Table 78-3 in addition to common associated symptoms.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

No specific historical or clinical features reliably distinguish between vasovagal syncope and other causes. A thorough history and physical examination  can  help  to  arouse  or  allay  suspicion  of  serious  causes.  The  most important step in evaluation of children with syncope is a detailed history, including  a  thorough  description  of  the  event,  associated  symptoms,  circumstances,  personal  or  family  history  of  cardiac  disease,  medications, drugs, intake, and intercurrent illness. Syncope during exercise suggests a more  serious  cause. Approximately  25%  of  children  who  suffer  sudden death have a history of syncope. If witnesses note that the patient appeared lifeless or cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, a search for serious pathologic conditions must be undertaken.

The  physical  examination  includes  complete  cardiovascular  (heart sounds, murmurs, rhythm, and the character of pulses), neurologic, and pulmonary  examinations.  Strongly  consider  obtaining  an  ECG  on  all patients  with  syncope.  Routine  bloodwork  is  not  indicated  in  children with clear vasovagal syncope. Tests should be directed by the history and exam:  a  classic  story  for  vasovagal  syncope  with  a  normal  physical examination  requires  no  further  testing.  Palpitations  or  exertional  syncope  require  ECG  evaluation  for  potential  dysrhythmias.

# Hypoglycemia and Metabolic 79 CHAPTER

# Emergencies in Infants and Children

Teresa J. Riech

# ■ HYPOGLYCEMIA

Hypoglycemia in children  may  be  due  to  inadequate  oral  intake,  excess insulin,  low  levels  of  hyperglycemic  hormones  (e.g.,  cortisol  or  growth hormone), inborn errors of metabolism, or systemic infection. Prompt recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia are essential to avoid potentially severe and permanent neurologic injury, and bedside glucose testing should be considered in any neonate, infant, or child with altered mental status.

# Clinical Features

Hypoglycemic children may manifest symptoms related to adrenergic hormone release including tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremors, anxiety, irritability, and tachypnea. Severe hypoglycemia may result in apnea or seizures, particularly  in  neonates  and  infants,  who  may  not  manifest  typical  signs and  symptoms  of  older  children  and  adults.  Neonates  and  infants  with hypoglycemia may also present with altered mental status and nonspecific symptoms such as poor feeding, an abnormal or high-pitched cry, temperature instability, and irritability or lethargy. Hypoglycemia often accompanies critical illness (sepsis) and the features of that illness may dominate the clinical picture, thereby masking the signs of hypoglycemia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Hypoglycemia  is  defined  as  a  plasma  glucose  concentration  less  than 45 mg/dL in symptomatic children and less than 35 mg/dL in asymptomatic neonates. Bedside glucose testing is the most important diagnostic test in any  neonate  or  infant  who  is  critically  ill  or  has  altered  mental  status. Abnormal results should be confirmed with a venous sample, but treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory results. Urine testing for ketones is important,  as  ketonuria  is  associated  with  ketotic  hypoglycemia,  adrenal insufficiency, and other inborn errors of metabolism. Absent urine ketones are associated with hyperinsulinemic states, infants of a diabetic mother, as well as disorders of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondria.

# ■ INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM

Inborn errors of metabolism are challenging childhood disorders representing  a  broad  spectrum  of  diseases  with  nonspecific  signs  and  symptoms. Delay in accurate diagnosis and treatment can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the myriad etiologies, the principles of initial emergency department (ED) diagnosis and management are relatively simple. The sudden acute deterioration of a healthy neonate should always prompt consideration  of  metabolic  disease,  and  making  a  definitive  diagnosis  is less  important  than  having  a  high  index  of  suspicion  and  implementing supportive care.

# Clinical Features

Vomiting,  altered  mental  status,  and  poor  feeding  are  the  most  common features of metabolic emergencies. Seizures may accompany some metabolic  crises.  Tachypnea  due  to  metabolic  acidosis  and  tachycardia  from dehydration, as well as hypotension due to hypovolemia or adrenal insufficiency, may be noted. Rarely, some metabolic disorders may be associated with characteristic body or urine odors or other phenotypic stigmata (e.g., ambiguous genitalia and hyperpigmentation in congenital adrenal hyperplasia,  as  discussed  separately  below).  Most  metabolic  toxins  cross  the placenta  and  are  cleared  by  maternal  enzymes;  therefore,  newborns  are asymptomatic, and symptoms present after feeding begins.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Screening  laboratory  tests  for  suspected  inborn  errors  of  metabolism include  a  bedside  glucose,  urine  for  ketones,  a  blood  gas  analysis  for metabolic  acidosis,  serum  ammonia,  basic  metabolic  panel,  and  lactate level.  Figure  79-1  details  the  diagnostic  evaluation  recommended in the ED.  Additional  laboratory  tests  for  definitive  diagnosis  that  should  be considered based on initial screening results include liver function tests, CBC, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, serum amino acids and acylcarnitine  profile,  urine  organic  acids,  and  reducing  substances. The  differential  diagnosis  of  shock  in  the  neonate  includes  sepsis,  congenital heart defects, and abdominal catastrophes.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Despite the diverse etiology and complexity of inborn errors of metabolism, ED resuscitation and stabilization of patients with these disorders are relatively simple. Neonates, infants, and children presenting in metabolic crisis, regardless of cause, show some combination of dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and encephalopathy, which must be immediately addressed. The goals of treatment are to improve circulatory status by restoring circulatory  volume,  provide  energy  substrate  to  halt  catabolism,  remove  the

for dextrose and specific treatment. Transfer to a pediatric hospital may be required (Table 79-1).

# ■ CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

Congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia  results  from  deficiency  in  one  of  the enzymes involved in the production of cortisol, which leads to decreased cortisol  levels  sometimes  accompanied  by  mineralocorticoid  deficiency ('salt wasting syndrome'). Steroid precursors may be shunted to androgen production with virilization of females.

# Clinical Features

Patients with salt-wasting adrenal hyperplasia typically present in the second to fifth week of life with nonspecific symptoms including shock, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and poor feeding. On examination, females may have  clitoromegaly  and  males  may  have  a  small  penis  or  hypospadias. Hyperpigmentation may be noted on axillae and around the nipples.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The most important laboratory tests include bedside glucose and electrolytes,  as  hyponatremia  and  hyperkalemia  are  often  present  and  suggest the diagnosis. Serum potassium levels of 6 to 12 mEq/kg are not unusual but  are  rarely  associated  with  ECG  abnormalities.  Definitive  diagnosis depends on analysis of blood hormone levels. If possible, blood should be obtained for analysis before treatment with exogenous steroids; however, treatment should not be delayed in the critically ill neonate. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, congenital heart disease, and other inborn errors of metabolism.

Neonates with adrenal crisis from adrenal hyperplasia require hospitalization. Infants with shock or severe hyperkalemia should be admitted to the  ICU  with  endocrine  consultation.  Those  with  a  known  diagnosis  of adrenal hyperplasia who have normal vital signs and are able to tolerate oral intake may be discharged home after administration of hydrocortisone as above with instructions to triple their usual home dose of steroid until fever, vomiting, or diarrhea resolve and when next-day follow-up can be assured) (Table 79-2).

# Diabetes in Children

Adam Vella

Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, is characterized by an abrupt and frequently  complete  decline  in  insulin  production.  Type  2  diabetes  is marked by increasing insulin resistance and occurs in overweight adolescents with a strong genetic predisposition. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with diabetes < 24 years of age, and cerebral edema is the leading cause of mortality in DKA.

DKA is much more common in patients with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2, but patients with type 2 diabetes may develop hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar  nonketotic  syndrome  (HHNS)  with  acidosis,  which can result in severe total body water, potassium, and phosphorus deficits. About 4% of children with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes present with HHNS, which has a case fatality rate of 12%.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia are the classic triad leading to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Other common symptoms include weight loss, secondary enuresis, anorexia, vague abdominal discomfort, visual changes, and genital candidiasis in a toilet-trained child. Symptoms of DKA  include  excessive  thirst,  weakness,  vomiting,  loss  of  appetite, confusion,  abdominal  pain,  shortness  of  breath,  and  a  generally  illappearance. Occasionally, children with DKA present to the ED complaining  primarily  of  abdominal  pain,  which  may  mimic  acute appendicitis;  Kussmaul  breathing  (hyperpnea  from  acidosis)  may  be mistaken for hyperventilation from anxiety or respiratory distress from pulmonary disease.

Premonitory symptoms of cerebral edema occur in 50% of patients and include  severe  headache,  declining  mental  status,  and  seizures.  Cerebral edema is rare (0.5% to 1% of all children presenting with DKA) but typically occurs 6 to 12 hours after initiating therapy. Although the etiology of this complication is unknown, it is felt that several factors may contribute, including young age, severe hyperosmolality, severe acidosis, and failure of the serum sodium level to rise commensurately with the fall in glucose level during therapy.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The diagnosis of diabetes is established by demonstrating hyperglycemia and  glucosuria  in  the  absence  of  other  causes  such  as  steroid  therapy, Cushing  syndrome,  pheochromocytoma,  hyperthyroidism,  or  other  rare disorders. DKA is generally defined as a metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.30 or serum  bicarbonate  level  of < 15  mEq/L)  with  hyperglycemia  (serum glucose level of > 200 mg/dL) in the presence of ketonemia or ketonuria. In adolescent patients without known diabetes, consider toxic ingestions of ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or salicylates.

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

Cerebral edema in DKA is a clinical diagnosis based on altered mental status  not  attributed  to  hypovolemia.  Treatment  should  begin  prior  to obtaining head CT when suspected. CT imaging can confirm the diagnosis, and intracranial pressure monitoring may be indicated.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The  treatment  of  DKA  consists  of  judicious  fluid  resuscitation,  insulin therapy,  correction  of  electrolyte  abnormalities,  and  close  monitoring. Patients should be placed on a cardiac monitor, noninvasive blood pressure device, and pulse oximetry, and intravenous lines should be established.

intensive care settings. Patients with cerebral edema require ICU admission  and  possible  intracranial  pressure  monitoring.  Consultation  with the  patient's  primary  care  physician  and  a  pediatric  endocrinologist should be made early in the course of therapy.

# Fluid and Electrolyte Therapy in Infants and Children

Ron L. Kaplan

The most common disorder of fluid balance in children requiring emergency  care  is  dehydration.  Dehydration  is  the  result  of  a  negative  fluid balance that can result from decreased fluid intake, increased output (renal, GI, or insensible losses from the skin or respiratory tract), or conditions such as sepsis, burns, and diabetes.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The presence of fluid and electrolyte disturbances is often suggested by a thorough history. Children with chronic underlying disease are at particular risk. The clinical appearance depends on the degree of dehydration, the rate at which the fluid was lost, and the age of the patient.

Though the gold standard for assessing dehydration is comparison of pre-illness weight with weight on presentation to the emergency department (ED), a reliable and recent pre-illness weight is rarely available in the ED. Physical examination can provide an estimation of the degree of dehydration,  which  is  typically  classified  as  mild,  moderate,  or  severe. Clinical signs and symptoms of dehydration are listed in Table 81-1. An important exception to the reliability  of  signs  and  symptoms  to  predict degree of dehydration occurs in hypernatremic dehydration, when fluid

loss  occurs  primarily  from  the  interstitial  and  intracellular  spaces  and clinical signs of intravascular volume depletion may be minimal. In this setting, however, the skin may have a characteristic doughy feel.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

If available, the absolute and relative fluid deficit can be calculated from a pre-illness weight: 1 kg of weight loss is equivalent to 1 L of fluid deficit. In the absence of a reliable pre-illness comparison weight, the diagnosis of dehydration is based primarily on historical data and physical examination findings (Table 81-1).

Routine laboratory testing is not required in mild to moderate dehydration, but serum electrolytes and other studies may be indicated in the setting of severe dehydration, signs and symptoms of electrolyte abnormalities, or certain underlying medical conditions. A rapid bedside glucose test should be  done  on  any  child  presenting  with  altered  sensorium.  Infants  are  at particular risk of hypoglycemia.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

The management of fluid and electrolyte disturbances in infants and young children revolves around a few basic principles: (a) identification and treatment  of  shock;  (b)  administration  of  appropriate  fluids  to  replace  fluid deficits, ongoing losses, and maintenance fluid requirements; (c) identification  and  treatment  of  causes  that  have  specific  therapies  (e.g.,  diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis, and inborn errors of metabolism). The most common approaches to rehydration include oral rehydration therapy and parenteral therapy,  though  rehydration  through  nasogastric  tube  is  also  effective, simple, and well tolerated.

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

Isotonic fluids such as 5% dextrose in 0.9% saline should be used for maintenance  treatment  after  the  first  week  of  life  in  order  to  avoid iatrogenic hyponatremia. 10% dextrose with no electrolytes should be used on day 1 of life and 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline can be used on days 2 to 7 of life.

Most children with mild to moderate dehydration can be managed as outpatients without any laboratory evaluation in the emergency department. Admission  criteria  include  young  infants  with  ongoing  significant  fluid losses;  severe  dehydration;  significant  electrolyte  or  metabolic  derangements; persistent  vomiting  and  failed  attempts  at  oral  rehydration;  or  an underlying diagnosis requiring ongoing inpatient treatment (e.g., DKA or inborn errors of metabolism).

# Musculoskeletal Disorders in Children

Mark X. Cicero

# ■ CHILDHOOD PATTERNS OF INJURY

The growth plate (physis) is the weakest point in children's long bones and the frequent site of fractures. The ligaments and periosteum are stronger than the physis; therefore, they tolerate mechanical forces at the expense of physeal injury. The blood supply to the physis arises from the epiphysis, so separation of the physis from the epiphysis may result in growth arrest. The Salter-Harris  classification  is  used  to  describe  fractures  involving  the growth plate (Figs. 82-1 and 82-2).

432

--- Page 453 ---

CHAPTER 82: Musculoskeletal Disorders in Children

433

# Salter-Harris Type i Fracture

In type I physeal fracture, the epiphysis separates from the metaphysis. The reproductive cells of the physis stay with the epiphysis. There are no bony fragments, and these injuries have a low incidence of growth disturbance.  Diagnosis  is  suspected  clinically  in  children  with  point tenderness over a physis. On radiograph, there may be no abnormality; there may be an associated joint effusion; or there may be epiphyseal displacement  from  the  metaphysis.  In  the  absence  of  epiphyseal displacement,  the  diagnosis  is  clinical.  Treatment  consists  of  splint immobilization, ice, elevation, and referral to orthopedics. Type I fractures of the distal fibula are not associated with growth arrest and can be followed by a primary care physician (PCP) or by orthopedics after splinting.

--- Page 454 ---

434 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Salter-Harris Type ii Fracture

A  type  II  physeal  fracture  goes  through  the  physis  and  out  through  the metaphysis.  Growth  is  preserved  because  the  physis  remains  with  the epiphysis.  Diagnosis  is  made  by  noting  a  metaphyseal  triangular-shaped fragment  without  epiphyseal  involvement  on  radiograph.  Treatment  is closed  reduction  (if  necessary)  with  analgesia  and  sedation  followed  by splint or cast immobilization, and follow-up with orthopedics.

# Salter-Harris Type iii Fracture

The hallmark of type III physeal fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the  epiphysis  with  the  cleavage  plane  continuing  along  the  physis.  The prognosis for bone growth depends on the circulation to the epiphyseal bone fragment and is usually favorable. Diagnosis is made radiographically with an epiphyseal fragment without a metaphyseal fracture. Reduction  of  the  unstable  fragment  with  anatomic  alignment  of  the  articular surface is critical. Open reduction is sometimes required.

# Salter-Harris Type iV Fracture

The fracture line of type IV physeal fractures begins at the articular surface and extends through the epiphysis,  physis,  and  metaphysis.  Diagnosis  is made  radiographically  with  both  epiphyseal  and  metaphyseal  fractures. Especially when there is displacement of the bony fragments, open reduction is usually required to reduce the risk of premature bone growth arrest.

# Salter-Harris Type V Fracture

In type V physeal fracture, severe compressive forces essentially crush the physis. There is usually no epiphyseal displacement. The diagnosis is often difficult. An initial diagnosis of sprain or type I injury may prove incorrect when later growth arrest occurs. Radiographs may look normal or demonstrate focal narrowing of the epiphyseal plate. There is usually an associated joint effusion. Treatment consists of casting, nonweight bearing, and close orthopedic follow-up in anticipation of bone growth arrest.

# Torus Fractures, greenstick Fractures, and Plastic Deformities

Children's long bones are more compliant than those of adults and tend to  bow  and  bend  under  forces  where  an  adult's  might  fracture.  Torus ( buckle ) fractures involve a bulging or buckling of the bony cortex, usually  of  the  metaphysis.  Patients  have  point  tenderness  over  the  fracture site and soft tissue swelling. Radiographs may be subtle but show cortical disruption.  Torus  fractures  are  not  typically  angulated,  rotated,  or  displaced, so reduction is not necessary. Splinting in a position of function for 3 to 4 weeks is often preferred over casting. Orthopedic follow-up is usually recommended.

In greenstick fractures, the cortex and periosteum are disrupted on one side of the bone but intact on the other. If the degree of angulation is significant, treatment is closed reduction and immobilization.

Plastic deformities, also known as bowing or bending fractures, are seen in the forearm and lower leg in combination with a completed fracture in the companion bone. The diaphyseal cortex is deformed, but the periosteum

--- Page 455 ---

CHAPTER 82: Musculoskeletal Disorders in Children

435

is  intact.  Treatment  requires  prompt  orthopedic  consultation  for  closed reduction and realignment.

# ■ FRACTURES ASSOCIATED WITH CHILD ABUSE

Certain injury patterns are consistently seen in abused children, particularly multiple fractures in various stages of healing. Please see Chapter 187 for details.

# ■ SELECTED PEDIATRIC INJURIES

# Clavicle Fracture

Clavicles are commonly fractured in children, and may occur in newborns during difficult deliveries, presenting in neonates with nonuse of the arm. If the fracture was not initially appreciated, parents may notice a bony callus at age 2 to 3 weeks. In older infants and children, the usual mechanism is a fall onto the outstretched arm or shoulder. Care of the patient with a clavicle fracture  is  directed  toward  pain  control.  Even  displaced  fractures  usually heal well, although patients may have a residual bump at the fracture site. A simple  sling  is  effective  and  less  painful  than  other  methods  of  clavicle immobilization. Newborns require no specific treatment. Orthopedic consultation in the emergency department (ED) is required for an open fracture (which also requires antibiotics), displacement of the medial clavicle, or a skin-tenting fracture fragment that has the potential to convert to an open fracture. Otherwise, routine follow-up with the PCP is usually adequate.

# Supracondylar and Condylar Fractures

The most common elbow fracture in childhood is the supracondylar fracture  of  the  distal  humerus.  The  mechanism  is  commonly  a  fall  onto  the outstretched arm. Children complain of pain on passive elbow flexion and hold the forearm pronated. The close proximity of the brachial artery to the fracture predisposes the artery to injury. Subsequent arterial spasm or compression  by  casts  may  further  compromise  distal  circulation. A  forearm compartment syndrome (resulting in Volkmann ischemic contracture) may occur.

Radiographs  show  the  injury,  but  the  findings  may  be  subtle.  Type  I fractures have no displacement or angulation, or may have a posterior fat pad as the only radiographic manifestation of a fracture. Confirmation of a fracture may be seen on an x-ray taken 2 to 4 weeks later, when a periosteal reaction is visible. Type II fractures are angulated, but the posterior cortex is intact, while type III fractures are completely displaced with no cortical contact.

In cases of neurovascular compromise, immediate fracture reduction is  indicated.  If  an  ischemic  forearm  compartment  is  suspected  after reduction,  surgical  decompression  or  arterial  exploration  may  be  indicated. Outpatient treatment is acceptable for type I fractures after appropriate  immobilization.  Such  children  need  orthopedic  reassessment within  2  to  7  days.  Orthopedic  consultation  and  admission  is  recommended for patients with type II or III fractures. Open reduction with operative pinning is usually required.

--- Page 456 ---

436 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

Lateral and medial condylar fractures and intercondylar and transcondylar  fractures  carry  risks  of  neurovascular  compromise,  especially  to  the ulnar nerve. These patients have soft tissue swelling and tenderness while maintaining the arm in flexion. Depending on the displacement visualized on x-ray, patients may require open reduction.

# radial Head Subluxation ('Nursemaid's elbow')

Radial  head  subluxation  is  a  very  common  injury  seen  most  often  in children 1 to 4 years of age. The typical history is that the child was lifted or pulled by the hand or wrist, though 50% have no such history and parents may report a fall or simply that their child refuses to use the arm. The arm is held in adduction, flexed at the elbow, with the forearm pronated. Gentle examination demonstrates no tenderness to direct palpation, but attempts to supinate  the  forearm  or  move  the  elbow  cause  pain.  If  the  history  and examination are strongly suggestive, radiographs are not needed. However, if  the  history  is  atypical  or  there  is  point  tenderness  or  signs  of  trauma, radiographs should be obtained.

There are two maneuvers for reduction. The first, the supination/flexion technique, is performed by holding the patient's elbow at 90° with one hand and then firmly supinating the wrist and simultaneously flexing the elbow so that the wrist is directed to the ipsilateral shoulder. There may be a 'click' with reduction, and the child may transiently cry and resist. The second, the hyperpronation technique, is reported to be more successful. The hyperpronation technique is performed by holding the child's elbow at 90° in one hand and then firmly pronating the wrist while extending the elbow. Usually the  child  will  resume  normal  activity  in  5  to  10  minutes  if  reduction  is achieved. If the child is not better after a second reduction attempt, alternate diagnoses  and  radiographs  should  be  considered.  No  specific  therapy  is needed  after  successful  reduction.  Parents  should  be  reminded  to  avoid linear traction on the arm because there is a risk of recurrence.

# Forearm injuries

# Torus Fractures

Torus fractures, also called buckle fractures, are among the most common pediatric bony injuries and may occur in the radius or ulna. Treatment consists of pain management with NSAIDs, application of a volar splint, and follow-up with the PCP or orthopedics in 1 to 3 weeks.

# Fractures of the radial and ulnar Shafts

# Metaphyseal Fractures

Any metaphyseal fracture with rotational deformity or more than 10 degrees of angulation in children above 8 years of age, or more than 15 to 20 degrees in younger children, requires consultation with an orthopedist to determine the need for reduction. Otherwise, immobilization in a splint with follow-up with orthopedics within 1 week is adequate treatment.

# Diaphyseal Fractures

Most diaphyseal forearm fractures warrant urgent orthopedic consultation. Transverse  fractures  of  one  or  both  bones  may  remain  unstable  despite

--- Page 457 ---

CHAPTER 82: Musculoskeletal Disorders in Children

437

attempts at closed reduction. Two fracture-dislocation injuries with especially guarded prognoses are an ulnar fracture with a radial head dislocation (Monteggia's fracture) and a radial shaft fracture with distal radioulnar joint dislocation (Galeazzi's fracture).

# Wrist Fractures

Carpal bone injuries are rare in young children, and gain frequency in older children and adolescents, when athletic pursuits generate greater force. The scaphoid fracture requires a high index of suspicion. Snuffbox tenderness and  tenderness  of  the  lateral  wrist  with  axial  compression  of  the  thumb warrant application of a thumb spica splint and follow-up with an orthopedist, even when radiographs show no scaphoid fracture.

# Lower extremity injuries

# Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is more common in obese children, with a peak incidence between ages 14 and 16 years (11 and 13 years in girls). Clinically, the child presents with pain at the hip or referred to the thigh or knee. With a chronic SCFE, children complain of dull pain in the groin, anteromedial thigh, and knee, which becomes worse with activity. With  walking,  the  leg  is  externally  rotated  and  the  gait  is  antalgic.  Hip flexion  is  restricted  and  accompanied  by  external  rotation  of  the  thigh. Acute SCFE is due to trauma or may occur in a patient with preexisting chronic SCFE.

The differential  includes  septic  arthritis,  toxic  synovitis,  Legg-CalvéPerthes disease, and other hip fractures. Children with SCFE are not febrile or toxic and have normal white blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Obtain bilateral hip radiographs in any adolescent with hip pain. Bilateral  anteroposterior  and  frog-leg  lateral  radiographs  of  the  hips  are preferred. Medial slips of the femoral epiphysis will be seen on anteroposterior views, whereas frog-leg views detect posterior slips. In the anteroposterior view, a line along the superior femoral neck should transect the lateral quarter of the femoral epiphysis, and will not if the epiphysis is slipped.

The management of SCFE is operative. Immediate non-weight-bearing upon diagnosis is important and admission for surgical pinning is typical. The main long-term complication is avascular necrosis of the femoral head and premature closure of the physis.

# Femoral Fracture

All femoral shaft fractures should prompt emergent orthopedic consultation. In infants and nonambulatory children with femoral fractures, evaluation  for  nonaccidental  trauma  is  warranted.  In  young  children  who  are injured,  femur  fractures  rarely  cause  hypotension.  When  hypotension  is present, searching for another serious hemorrhagic injury is key.

# Knee injuries

# Fractures of the Distal Femoral Physis

Fractures through the distal femoral physis are uncommon yet carry a significant complication rate. The popliteal artery lies close to the distal

--- Page 458 ---

438 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

femoral metaphysis and may be injured along with the peroneal nerve. In these cases, immediate orthopedic evaluation is needed.

# Patellar Dislocation

Often, there is a history of the kneecap 'popping' out of place. Reduction is  performed  by  extending  the  affected  knee  while  gently  'lifting'  the patella  medially  into  place. After  reduction,  radiographs  are  obtained  to evaluate for fracture. A knee immobilizer and crutches are provided, and follow-up is with orthopedics.

# Tibia Fractures

# Toddler's Fracture

The toddler's fracture is an isolated spiral fracture of the distal tibia in a toddler. The typical mechanism is external rotation of the foot with the knee flexed. Clinically, there is often refusal to bear weight, and usually pain with palpation and rotation of the distal tibia, although swelling may be  minimal  or  absent  and  occasionally  there  is  no  tenderness.  Obtain radiographs  with  standard  and  oblique  views  of  the  leg  in  the  limping toddler,  even  in  the  absence  of  physical  examination  findings.  Radiographically, a fracture line may be noticed at the distal third of the tibial shaft. If a toddler's fracture is clinically suspected and initial radiographs are negative, immobilization and no immobilization are both management options with follow-up in 1 week for repeat x-rays and/or bone scan or MRI. The leg should not be in a circumferential cast if the diagnosis is not  clear.  For  fractures  evident  on  radiograph,  immobilize  the  leg  in  a long leg splint or above knee cast with adequate flexion for car seat use and provide orthopedic follow-up within 72 hours for definitive casting if not done in the ED.

Distal  tibial  Salter-Harris  types  I  and  II  fractures  are  the  most common tibial  fractures  in  children.  If  any  significant  displacement  is evident,  closed  reduction  and  immobilization are usually sufficient ED management. The Salter-Harris type III fracture of the distal tibia typically  requires  open  reduction  when  there  is  displacement.  The  Tillaux fracture  is  a  Salter-Harris  type  III  fracture  through  the  anterolateral physis: it is usually managed surgically. The triplane fracture is a SalterHarris type IV fracture. A computed tomography scan is warranted, and management is usually surgical.

# Foot and Ankle injuries

Most nondisplaced fractures of the metatarsals and phalanges can be managed by immobilization in a posterior short-leg splint and follow-up with an  orthopedist.  Significantly  displaced  fractures  of  the  metatarsals  and phalanges, as well as those of the great toe, that have intra-articular involvement may require fixation, although this can typically be done on an outpatient basis. Fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal are common with inversion injuries of the ankle as in adults. The evaluation of ankle injuries should therefore include radiographs of the foot when there is tenderness over the fifth metatarsal bone.

# ■ SELECTED NONTRAUMATIC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD

Kawasaki's disease is discussed in Chapter 83.

# Acute Septic Arthritis

Septic arthritis occurs in all ages, but especially in children younger than 3 years. The hip is most often affected, followed by the knee and elbow. If left  untreated,  purulent  joint  infection  leads  to  total  joint  destruction. Please see Chapter 180, 'Acute Disorders of the Joints and Bursae' for additional information.

Radiographs may show joint effusion, but this is nonspecific. The differential includes osteomyelitis, transient synovitis, cellulitis, septic bursitis, acute pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), acute rheumatic fever, hemarthrosis, and SCFE. Distinguishing septic arthritis from osteomyelitis  may  be  quite  difficult.  Osteomyelitis  is  more  tender  over  the metaphysis, whereas septic arthritis is more tender over the joint line. Joint motion is much more limited in septic arthritis. Prompt arthrocentesis is the key to diagnosis at the bedside or, in the case of the hip, via ultrasound guidance. Synovial fluid shows WBCs and organisms.

Prompt open joint drainage and washout in the operating room is critical in  the  case  of  the  hip,  or  arthroscopically  or  via  arthrocentesis  in  more superficial joints. In all pediatric patients, when the organism is unknown, initial treatment is vancomycin 10 mg/kg IV every 6 hours or clindamycin 10  mg/kg  IV  every  6  hours and cefotaxime 50  mg/kg.  The  prognosis depends on the duration between symptoms and treatment, which joint is involved (worse for the hip), presence of associated osteomyelitis (worse), and the patient's age (worse for the youngest children).

# Henoch-Schönlein Purpura

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by  purpura,  arthritis,  abdominal  pain,  and  hematuria.  See  Chapter  74, 'Pediatric Abdominal Emergencies,' for a discussion of HSP.

# ■ SELECTED PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

# Transient Synovitis of the Hip

Transient or toxic synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain in children younger than 10 years. The peak age is 3 to 6 years, and the cause is unknown. Symptoms may be acute or gradual. Patients have pain in the hip, thigh, and knee, and an antalgic gait. Pain limits range of motion of the hip, but in contrast to septic arthritis, passive range of motion remains possible. There may be a low-grade fever, but patients do not appear toxic. The WBC and ESR are usually normal or mildly elevated. Radiographs of the hip are normal or show a mild to moderate effusion. The main concern is differentiation  from  septic  arthritis,  particularly  if  the  patients  are  febrile,  with elevation  of  WBC  or  ESR  and  effusion.  Diagnostic  arthrocentesis  is required  when  the  diagnosis  is  in  doubt  with  fluoroscopic  or  ultrasound guidance. The fluid in transient synovitis is a sterile clear transudate.

--- Page 460 ---

440 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

Once septic arthritis and hip fracture have been ruled out, patients can be treated with weight-bearing as tolerated, no strenuous activity for 1 to 2  weeks,  anti-inflammatory  agents  such  as ibuprofen 10  mg/kg  every 6 hours, and close follow-up.

# Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is avascular necrosis of the femoral head, complicated by a subchondral stress fracture. Collapse and flattening of the femoral head ensues, with a potential for subluxation. The result is a painful hip with limited range of motion, muscle spasm, and soft tissue contractures.  Children  have  a  limp  and  chronic  dull  pain  in  the  groin, thigh, and knee, which becomes worse with activity. Systemic symptoms are absent. Hip motion is restricted; there may be flexion and abduction contracture and thigh muscle atrophy. Initial radiographs in the first 1 to 3 months show widening of the cartilage space in the affected hip and diminished ossific nucleus of the femoral head. The second sign is subchondral  stress  fracture  of  the  femoral  head.  The  third  finding  is increased  femoral  head  opacification.  Deformity  of  the  femoral  head then occurs, with subluxation and protrusion of the femoral head from the acetabulum.

Bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging are very helpful in making this diagnosis by showing bone abnormalities well before plain films. The differential  diagnosis  includes  transient  synovitis,  tuberculous  arthritis, tumors, and bone dyscrasias.

In  the  ED,  it  is  key  to  consider  this  chronic  and  potentially  crippling condition. Initial management is non-weight-bearing and referral to a pediatric orthopedist for definitive care.

# Osgood-Schlatter Disease

Osgood-Schlatter  disease  is  common,  and  affects  boys  more  than  girls, usually between the ages of 10 and 15 years. The cause is repetitive stress on the tibial tuberosity by the quadriceps muscle, leading to inflammation. Prolonged  basketball  play  is  a  frequent  culprit.  Children  have  pain  and tenderness  over  the  tuberosity,  and  symptoms  are  usually  bilateral.  The patellar tendon is thick and tender, with the tibial tuberosity enlarged and indurated.

Radiographs show soft tissue swelling over the tuberosity and patellar tendon thickening without knee effusion. Normally, the ossification site at the tubercle at this age will be irregular, but the prominence of the tubercle is characteristic of Osgood-Schlatter disease.

The disorder is self-limited. Acute symptoms improve after temporary avoidance of the offending activity. Crutches may be necessary, with a knee immobilizer or cylinder cast rarely needed. Exercises to stretch taut  and hypertrophied quadriceps muscles are helpful.

# Acute rheumatic Fever

Acute  rheumatic  fever  (ARF)  is  an  acute  inflammatory  multisystem illness primarily affecting school-age children. It is not common in the United States, but there have been recent epidemics. ARF is preceded by infection  with  certain  strains  of  group  A β -hemolytic Streptococcus ,

--- Page 461 ---

CHAPTER 82: Musculoskeletal Disorders in Children

441

which stimulates antibody production to host tissues. Children develop ARF  2  to  6  weeks  after  symptomatic  or  asymptomatic  streptococcal pharyngitis. Arthritis, which occurs in most initial attacks, is migratory and polyarticular, primarily affecting the large joints. Carditis occurs in 33% of patients. Sydenham chorea occurs in 10% of patients and may occur months after the initial infection. The rash, erythema marginatum, is fleeting, faint, and serpiginous, usually accompanying carditis. Subcutaneous nodules, found on the extensor surfaces of extremities, are quite rare. Carditis confers greatest mortality and morbidity.

Various tests  are  used  to  confirm  prior  streptococcal  infection  (throat culture and streptococcal serology) or to assess carditis (electrocardiogram, chest  radiograph,  and  echocardiogram).  The  differential  includes  JIA, septic arthritis, Kawasaki's disease, leukemia, and other cardiomyopathies and vasculitides. In the ED, carditis is the main management issue. Most patients are admitted.

Significant carditis is managed initially with prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d. Arthritis is treated with high-dose aspirin 75 to 100 mg/kg/d to start. All children with ARF are treated with penicillin (or erythromycin , if allergic): benzathine penicillin 600,000 to 1.2 million U IM is given based on weight or  oral penicillin VK 250  mg  for  young  children  and  500  mg  for  older children given twice daily for 10 days. Long-term prophylaxis is indicated for patients with ARF, and lifelong prophylaxis is recommended for patients with carditis.

# Post-infectious reactive Arthritis

Because of increased group A β -hemolytic streptococcal infections, postinfectious  reactive  arthritis  (PIRA)  is  also  increasing.  PIRA  is  a  sterile, inflammatory, nonmigratory mono- or oligoarthritis occurring with infection  at  a  distant  site  with β -hemolytic Streptococcus ,  or  less  commonly with Staphylococcus or Salmonella .  Unlike ARF, PIRA is not associated with  carditis  and  in  general  is  a  milder  illness.  However,  the  arthritis  in PIRA is more severe and prolonged as compared with ARF.

To  make  the  diagnosis  of  PIRA,  antecedent  infection  with  group A Streptococcus must be determined with throat culture or fourfold rise in ASO  or  anti-DNase  B  titer.  PIRA  is  responsive  to  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory drugs. If group A Streptococcus is recovered from the throat, treatment with penicillin or erythromycin should be instituted.

# Juvenile idiopathic Arthritis

The  group  of  diseases  comprised  by  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA) share  the  findings  of  chronic  noninfectious  synovitis  and  arthritis,  but with systemic manifestations. Pauciarticular disease is the most common form, usually involving a single large joint such as the knee. Permanent joint  damage  occurs  infrequently.  Polyarticular  disease  occurs  in  onethird of cases. Large and small joints are affected, and there may be progressive joint damage. Systemic JIA occurs in 20% of patients. This form is  associated  with  high  fevers  and  chills.  Extra-articular  manifestations are common, including a red macular coalescent rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and serositis. The arthritis in this form may progress to permanent joint damage.

--- Page 462 ---

442

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

In the ED, laboratory tests focus mostly on excluding other diagnoses. Complete  blood  count,  ESR,  and  C-reactive  protein  may  be  normal. Arthrocentesis may be necessary to exclude septic arthritis, particularly in  pauciarticular disease. Radiographs initially show joint effusions but are nonspecific. The diagnosis of JIA is not likely to be made in the ED.

Initial  therapy  for  patients  with  an  established  diagnosis  includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Glucocorticoids are occasionally used, for example, for unresponsive uveitis or decompensated pericarditis or myocarditis.

# Rashes in Children

Lance Brown

Though rarely life-threatening, rashes are a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits in children. Helpful clues to the specific diagnosis of rash in a child include signs and symptoms that preceded or presented with the exanthem, whether mucous membranes are involved, immunization  history,  human  and  animal  contacts,  and  environmental  exposures. Identifying  outbreaks  among  multiple  children  may  be  useful.  Pediatric exanthems can be broadly classified by etiologic agent. With few exceptions, outpatient management is appropriate for most of these conditions.

# ■ VIRAL INFECTIONS

# Enterovirus

Enteroviruses  include coxsackie  viruses , echoviruses ,  and polioviruses with a diverse range of clinical presentations. Enterovirus infections typically  occur  in  epidemics  in  the  summer  and  early  fall.  Many  enteroviral infections  lack  specific  clinical  syndromes  and  presentation  may  include fever, upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, meningitis, and myocarditis. The rashes of enteroviral infections also have a variety of appearances, including diffuse macular eruptions, morbilliform erythema, vesicular lesions, petechial and purpural eruptions, rubelliform rash, roseola-like rash, and scarlatiniform eruptions.

One distinctive enteroviral infection is hand-foot-and-mouth disease . Initially, patients typically present with fever, anorexia, malaise, and a sore mouth.  Oral  lesions  appear  on  days  2  or  3  of  illness  followed  by  skin lesions. The oral lesions start as very painful 4- to 8- mm vesicles on an erythematous  base  that  then  ulcerate.  The  typical  location  of  the  oral lesions  is  on  the  buccal  mucosa,  tongue,  soft  palate,  and  gingiva.  Skin lesions start as red papules that change to gray-3- to 7-mm vesicles that ultimately heal in 7 to 10 days. Typical locations of skin lesions include the palms, soles, and buttocks. A similar enanthum without involvement of the hands and feet is caused by a different viral subtype and is known as herpangina (most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A).

Management  of  presumed  enteroviral  infections  typically  involves symptomatic therapy ensuring adequate hydration, antipyretics/analgesics, or a combined suspension of diphenhydramine liquid and Maalox ®  applied in small quantities to the lesions (or swish and spit) three times daily and before feeding. Occasional narcotics may be required to facilitate adequate outpatient hydration.

# Measles

Due to immunizations, measles is no longer common, but recent outbreaks have occurred among unimmunized groups. Infection typically occurs in the winter and spring. The incubation period is 10 days, followed by a 3-day prodrome of upper respiratory symptoms and then malaise, fever, coryza, conjunctivitis,  photophobia,  and  cough.  Ill  appearance  is  expected.  Just

443

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

before the development of a rash, Koplik spots, tiny white lesions on the buccal  mucosa,  may  be  seen  with  a  'grains  of  sand'  appearance  that  is pathognomonic for measles. The exanthem develops 14 days after exposure. Initially, a red, blanching, maculopapular rash develops. The rash progresses from the head to the feet and rapidly coalesces on the face, and lasts about a week. As the rash resolves, a coppery brown discoloration may be seen and desquamation can occur. Measles is self-limited and treatment is supportive.

# Rubella

Now quite rare  due  to  immunizations,  rubella  (German  measles)  can  be seen in teenagers, typically in the spring. The incubation period is 12 to 25 days and prodromal symptoms are similar to measles. The rash develops as fine, irregular pink macules and papules on the face that spread to the neck, trunk, and arms in a centrifugal distribution. The rash coalesces on the face as the eruption reaches the lower extremities and then clears in the same order as it appeared. Lymphadenopathy typically involves the suboccipital and posterior auricular nodes. Treatment is supportive.

# Erythema Infectiosum

Erythema  infectiosum  (also  known  as fifth  disease )  is  a  febrile  illness caused  by  parvovirus  B19,  typically  occurring  in  the  spring,  and  most commonly affecting children ages 5 to 15 years. The rash starts abruptly as  a  bright  red  macular  discoloration  on  the  cheeks  producing  the 'slapped-cheek appearance' (Fig. 83-1). The lesions are closely grouped,

--- Page 465 ---

CHAPTER 83: Rashes in Children

445

tiny papules on an erythematous base with slightly raised edges. The eyelids and chin are characteristically spared. Circumoral pallor is typical. The rash fades after 4 to 5 days. As the illness progresses, and 1 to 2 days after the facial rash appears, a nonpruritic erythematous macular or maculopapular rash appears on the trunk and limbs. This rash may last for 1 week and is  not  pruritic. As  the  rash  fades,  central  clearing  of  the  lesions  occurs, leaving a lacy reticular appearance. Palms and soles are rarely affected.

The exanthem may recur intermittently in the weeks after the onset of illness.  Sun  exposure  or  hot  baths  may  exacerbate  the  rash.  Associated symptoms  include  fever,  malaise,  headache,  sore  throat,  cough,  coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias. Treatment is supportive.

# Eczema Herpeticum

In children with existing eczema, this life-threatening, rare, viral infection can arise. The most frequent etiologic agent is herpes simplex virus. Bacterial  superinfection  with  staphylococci  or  streptococci  is  presumed. Clinical manifestations of eczema herpeticum include fever and vesicular eruptions  in  areas  of  skin  contemporaneously  affected  by  eczematous lesions (Fig. 83-2). Treatment includes acyclovir 20 mg/kg/dose PO every

--- Page 466 ---

446

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

6 hours and either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5  mg/kg/dose  twice daily or clindamycin 10  mg/kg/dose three times daily for 10 days. Inpatient admission is often necessary.

# Varicella (Chicken Pox)

Due to immunizations, the incidence of varicella has declined dramatically.  The  etiologic  agent  is  varicella-zoster  virus,  a  herpes  virus.  It typically occurs in children younger than 10 years but may occur at all ages.  Varicella  occurs  most  often  in  the  late  winter  and  early  spring. Patients  are  highly  contagious  from  the  prodrome  phase  of  the  illness until all lesions are crusted over. The rash starts as faint red macules on the scalp or trunk. Within the first day, lesions begin to vesiculate and develop a red base, producing the characteristic appearance (Fig. 83-3). Over the next few days, groups of lesions develop, producing the classic appearance of crops of lesions in multiple stages of development. Over the next 1 to 2 weeks, lesions become dry and crusted. The rash typically spreads centrifugally (outward from the center). The palms and soles are usually spared. Low-grade fever, malaise, and headache are frequently seen  but  are  typically  mild.  Treatment  is  symptomatic  and  includes

--- Page 467 ---

CHAPTER 83: Rashes in Children

447

diphenhydramine 1.25 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours as needed for itching and acetaminophen 15 mg/kg/dose, every 4 hours as needed for fever. Although  not  needed  in  healthy  children, varicella-zoster  immune globulin and acyclovir 20 mg/kg up to 800 mg PO five times daily may be needed for immunocompromised children.

# Roseola Infantum (Exanthem Subitum)

Roseola  is  a  common  acute  febrile  illness  in  children  ages  6  months  to 3 years and thought to be caused by human herpesvirus 6. Roseola presents with an abrupt onset, high fever lasting 3 to 5 days. As the fever begins to resolve, blanching macular or maculopapular, rose or pink discrete lesions develop (Fig. 83-4). Areas typically affected include the neck, trunk, and buttocks  but  the  face  and  proximal  extremities  may  also  be  involved, though  mucous  membranes  are  spared.  The  rash  lasts  1  to  2  days  and rapidly  fades. Associated  symptoms  are  typically  mild  and  may  include irritability when the fever is highest, cough, coryza, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. The treatment is symptomatic.

--- Page 468 ---

448 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# ■ FUNGAL INFECTIONS

Tinea  infections  are  common  in  infants  and  children  and  named  for  the body parts affected: tinea capitis (scalp), corporis (body), and pedis (foot) are common examples. Tinea infections typically manifest as scaly patches with  pruritus  of  varying  intensity.  Successful  treatment  for  all  but  tinea capitis and unguium is usually accomplished with topical creams including those available over-the-counter ( clotrimazole, miconazole, tolnaftate ) or by  prescription  ( ketoconazole,  oxiconazole,  ciclopirox,  terbinafine ). Treatment is continued for 7 to 10 days after the resolution of lesions. Tinea capitis ranges from mild scalp scaliness with patchy alopecia to a painful, boggy  mass  known  as  a  kerion.  Tinea  capitis  is  treated  with  oral griseofulvin ultramicrosize  15  mg/kg/dose  once  daily  and selenium sulfide shampoo. Treatment of tinea capitis is usually for at least 8 weeks and close follow-up is important as treatment response and liver function tests need to be monitored. Tinea unguium is similarly treated with griseofulvin for longer periods of time.

# ■ BACTERIAL INFECTIONS

# Impetigo

Impetigo  is  a  superficial  skin  infection,  typically  caused  by  group  A β -hemolytic  streptococci  or Staphylococcus aureus .  The  lesions  usually occur in small children, often in areas of insect bites or minor trauma. The lesions start as red macules and papules that form vesicles and pustules (Fig.  83-5). The formation of a golden crust results from rupture of the vesicles.  The  lesions  may  become  confluent.  With  the  exception  of regional lymphadenopathy, fever and systemic signs are rare. Most commonly affected areas include the face, neck, and extremities. Diagnosis is

--- Page 469 ---

CHAPTER 83: Rashes in Children

449

based on the appearance of the rash. Localized infections may be treated with mupirocin ointment 2% applied three times daily. Larger infections should be treated with oral cephalexin 12.5 to 25  mg/kg/dose four times daily, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg/dose  twice  daily,  or clindamycin 10 mg/kg/dose three times daily. Further treatment includes local wound cleaning.

# Bullous Impetigo

Bullous impetigo typically occurs in infants and young children. Lesions are  superficial,  thin-walled  bullae  that  characteristically  occur  on  the extremities, rupture easily, leave a denuded base, dry to a shiny coating, and contain fluid that harbors staphylococci. The diagnosis usually is made by the  appearance  of  the  characteristic  bullae  (see  Fig.  83-6).  Treatment includes local wound cleaning, topical mupirocin , and an oral antistaphylococcal antibiotic such as clindamycin 10 mg/kg/dose three times daily or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg/dose twice daily.

--- Page 470 ---

450

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Scarlet Fever

A distinctive rash is seen with scarlet fever. The etiologic agent is group A β -hemolytic  streptococci  (recently  group  C  streptococci  also  have  been implicated). Scarlet fever usually occurs in school-age children and is diagnosed by the presence of exudative pharyngitis, fever, and the characteristic rash (Fig. 83-7). Associated symptoms include sore throat, fever, headache, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The rash starts in the neck, groin, and axillae, with accentuation at flexural creases (Pastia lines). The rash is red and punctate, blanches with pressure, and has a rough sandpaper feel. Early in the course of illness, the tongue has a white coating through which hypertrophic,  red  papillae  project  ('white  strawberry  tongue').  Hemorrhagic spots may be seen on the soft palate. The rash typically develops 1 to 2 days after the illness onset. Facial flushing and circumoral pallor are characteristic. Desquamation occurs with healing approximately 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

--- Page 471 ---

CHAPTER 83: Rashes in Children

451

The  diagnosis  generally  is  made  on  clinical  grounds.  Throat  culture typically shows group A β -hemolytic streptococci or group C streptococci. Treatment  is  with penicillin  V 16 mg/kg/dose  three  times  daily  or clindamycin 10  mg/kg/dose  three  times  daily  in  the  penicillin-allergic patient. Antibiotic treatment shortens the course of the illness and reduces the incidence of rheumatic fever.

# Cellulitis

Cellulitis manifests a local inflammatory response at the site of infection with  erythema,  warmth,  and  tenderness.  Fever  is  uncommon  and  likely indicates a more serious systemic infection, sepsis, or an unrelated concurrent viral infection. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is becoming an increasingly common cause of cellulitis in children. Traditionally, oral cephalexin 12.5 to 25 mg/kg/dose four  times  daily  has  been  the  antibiotic  of  choice. With  the  rise  of  CAMRSA, clindamycin 10  mg/kg/dose  three  times  daily  or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole 5  to  10  mg/kg/dose  twice  daily  are  more  common choices. Identifying underlying abscesses may require needle aspiration or bedside ultrasonography.

Erysipelas is a cellulitis and lymphangitis of the skin due to group A β -hemolytic  streptococci.  Fever,  chills,  malaise,  headache,  and  vomiting are common. The face and extremities are the most common sites, and the lesion typically forms in the area of a skin wound or pimple. The rash starts as  a  red  plaque  that  rapidly  enlarges.  Increased  warmth,  swelling,  and  a raised, sharply demarcated, indurated border are typical. Diagnosis is by history and the appearance of the rash. Initial treatment may be inpatient with parenteral penicillin G 50,000 U/kg/dose, every 6 hours or clindamycin 10 mg/kg/dose, every 8 hours in the penicillin-allergic patient. Outpatient treatment includes cephalexin 12.5 to 25  mg/kg/dose four times daily, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5  to  10 mg/kg/dose  twice  daily,  or clindamycin 10 mg/kg/dose three times daily. Rapid clinical improvement is expected after treatment has begun.

# Meningococcemia

Meningococcemia  should  be  suspected  in  an  ill-appearing  febrile  child with  a  petechial  or  purpuric  rash.  The  age  distribution  is  bimodal  with increased cases in infants and toddlers 2 years of age and younger and in adolescents 16 to 21 years of age. The etiologic agent is Neisseria meningitidis and empiric treatment is cefotaxime or ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/dose. Close contacts (those exposed through child care or exposure to oral secretions) should receive chemoprophylaxis such as rifampin 5  mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 2 days for neonates; 10 mg/kg up to 600 mg per dose orally every 12 hours for 2 days for children or ciprofloxacin 500 mg single dose for adults.

# ■ INFESTATIONS

# Scabies

Scabies is caused by infestation with the Sarcoptes scabiei mite that burrows into the skin resulting in severe pruritus after a 4 to 6 week incubation period.  Typical  findings  in  children  include  a  generalized  eruption  with

--- Page 472 ---

452 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

excoriated linear burrows, papules, pustules, and possibly vesicles. Family members and close contacts may have similar symptoms. Treatment consists of topical permethrin cream applied to avoid the mucous membranes and left on for 8 to 12 hours prior to washing it off. Lindane is contraindicated in infants and young children and pregnant teens.

# Lice

Lice is caused by Pediculus humanus capitis and is common among children in school and day care. Lice are more commonly found in long straight hair  in  which  the  live  mites  and  egg  sacs  can  be  seen.  Over-the-counter treatments  include permethrin 1%  lotion,  and  combination piperonyl butoxide/pyrethrum extract  shampoo.  A  fine-toothed  comb  is  usually provided in the product packaging for combing out the egg sacs. Repeat treatment after 1 week is typically indicated.

# ■ COMMON NEONATAL RAShES

# Erythema Toxicum

This benign, self-limited rash occurs in up to 50% of newborns during the first week of life. The lesions are typically erythematous macules 2 to 3 cm in  diameter  with  central  pustules.  The  rash  spontaneously  resolves  after about a week.

# Transient Neonatal Pustular Melanosis

This condition consists of three types of lesions: small pustules on a nonerythematous base that may be present at birth, erythematous macules with a  surrounding  scale  that  develop  as  the  pustules  rupture,  and  hyperpigmented brown macules. This may last weeks to months and requires no treatment.

# Neonatal Acne

This affects up to 20% of neonates and typically appears around the third week of life. Erythematous papules and pustules are on the face and are typical. No testing or treatment is indicated.

# Seborrheic Dermatitis

This rash typically starts between 2 to 6 weeks of life and improves by 6 months of life. Lesions are greasy yellow or red scales and typically involve the scalp (i.e., cradle cap) but may involve the eyebrows, ears, cheeks, and neck. This will typically resolve in weeks to months and can be treated with mineral or olive oil and gentle combing.

# Diaper Dermatitis

Diaper  rash  is  a  common  reason  for  ED  visits  in  neonates  and  young infants. There  are  two  main  forms  of  diaper  rash:  irritant  dermatitis  and candida  dermatitis.  Irritant  dermatitis  is  typically  caused  by  prolonged moisture in the sealed diaper. The lesions are typically erythematous and macular  or  papular  with  well-demarcated  borders.  Treatment  is  frequent diaper  changes  and  the  application  of  a  zinc  oxide-containing  barrier

--- Page 473 ---

CHAPTER 83: Rashes in Children

453

cream. Candida dermatitis is similar to irritant dermatitis in etiology and appearance with the exception of the presence of satellite lesions  (small pustules beyond the margins of the main rash). Treatment is frequent diaper changes, the application of a zinc oxide-containing barrier cream, and the application of nystatin cream or ointment 100,000 U/g three times per day for 10 to 14 days.

# ■ OThER ETIOLOGIES

# Kawasaki's Disease

Kawasaki's disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is a generalized vasculitis of unknown cause that typically occurs in children younger than 9 years. Diagnosis depends on the presence of fever for at least 5 days without another source, along with four of the following five criteria: ( a ) conjunctivitis; ( b )  rash; ( c )  lymphadenopathy; ( d )  oropharyngeal changes (injection  of  the  pharynx,  cracked  lips,  and  prominent  papillae  of  the tongue); and ( e ) extremity erythema and edema.

Typical rash appearances have been described as erythematous, morbilliform, urticarial, scarlatiniform, and erythema multiforme-like. A perineal rash may be present. Associated findings may include leukocytosis, elevation  of  acute-phase  reactants  (e.g.,  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  and C-reactive protein), elevated liver function tests, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, arthritis, arthralgia, and irritability. Later in the illness, findings may include a rise in the platelet count (usually more than 1 million), desquamation of the fingers and toes, and coronary artery aneurysms. One percent  to  2%  of  patients  with  coronary  artery  aneurysms  develop  sudden cardiac death.

Treatment consists of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin . The use of steroids is controversial.

# Henoch-Schönlein Purpura

Henoch-Schönlein  purpura  (HSP)  is  the  most  common  vasculitis  in childhood. There are four main features of HSP: palpable purpura ranging in size from 2 to 10 mm primarily involving the buttocks, thighs, legs, and arms;  gastrointestinal  symptoms  including  vomiting,  diarrhea,  and abdominal pain; polyarthralgias; and hematuria and proteinuria. Children with HSP are generally well appearing and afebrile. HSP is typically selflimited and requires no treatment and no laboratory evaluation other than urinalysis (and renal function tests in the presence of hematuria). Consideration can be given to prednisone 1  mg/kg/dose for 2 weeks followed by a  2-week  taper  for  severe  joint  and  gastrointestinal  symptoms  and ibuprofen 10 mg/kg/dose as needed every 6 hours for severe arthralgias and extremity edema.

# Erythema Multiforme

Erythema multiforme typically presents with an abrupt onset of rash without pruritis  and  is  characterized  by  a  well-appearing  child  with  target  lesions composed of two to three zones consisting of a dark, ruddy-appearing center and a lighter colored area surrounding the center with a red-appearing outer ring. Lesions present as coalescent plaques that frequently involve the palms

and soles. Mucous membranes are spared. The etiology can be medication exposure, but is most commonly an infection with a herpes virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). No treatment is required.

Sickle cell emergencies in children include vasoocclusive crises, hematologic  crises,  and  infections.  All  children  with  sickle  cell  anemia  (SCA) presenting with fever, pain, respiratory distress, or a change in neurologic function require a rapid and thorough ED evaluation.

# ■ VASOOCCLUSIVE CRISES

Vasoocclusive sickle episodes are due to intravascular sickling, which leads to tissue ischemia and infarction. Bones, soft tissue, viscera, and the central nervous system (CNS) may be affected. Pain may be the only symptom.

# ■ PAIN CRISES

# Clinical Features

Pain crises are the most common SCA-related presentation to the ED, and typically affect the long bones and back. They can be triggered by stress, extremes of cold, dehydration, hypoxia, or infection, but most often occur without a specific cause. In an individual patient, recurrent pain crises tend to be similar in location and quality to previous episodes. Although, typically, there are no physical findings, pain, local tenderness, swelling, and warmth may occur. Low-grade temperature elevations can occur, but true fever  is  rare.  Infants  and  toddlers  can  present  initially  with  dactylitis,  a swelling of hands or feet, and low-grade temperature caused by ischemia and infarction of the bone marrow.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Differentiating between infection and vasoocclusive crisis can be difficult,  particularly  since  infection  can  precipitate  a  pain  crisis.  Fever, limited  range  of  motion  of  a  joint,  and  pain  that  differs  in  location  or quality from previous crises should raise concern for an infection. Pain crises can be associated with leukocytosis; however, a left shift is suspicious for infection. Sedimentation rates are unreliable markers for infections in SCA patients due to anemia. All pain crises represent ischemia, but bony infarcts present with severe, difficult to control pain, significant tenderness, and leukocytosis. Patients with bony infarcts are at risk of fat embolism.

Pain localized to the hip or inguinal area worsening with weight-bearing may be due to avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which may demonstrate flattening and collapse of the femoral head on plain radiograph.

Abdominal pain resulting from vasoocclusive crises is common and is typically abrupt in onset, and poorly localized. Tenderness and guarding may be present on examination. Rebound and rigidity are usually absent. If not typical of a pain crisis, non-SCA-related causes need to be considered (e.g., appendicitis), as well as SCA-related cholelithiasis/cholecystitis

(can  occur  as  early  as  2  years  of  age),  intrahepatic  cholestasis  (sudden right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, jaundice, anorexia, hepatomegaly, and  sometimes  fever),  splenic  sequestration,  or  hepatic  sequestration (anemia  and  hepatomegaly).  Constipation,  urinary  tract  infection,  and peptic  ulcer  disease  are  more  common  in  SCA  patients.  Laboratories, ultrasound, and CT scan may be necessary to differentiate among these etiologies.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Pain management must be individualized, using previously effective regimens as a guide. Nonparenteral medications can be used (oral or nasal) to meet the goal of delivering analgesia within an hour of registration.

# 1. Mild pain

# 2. Moderate to severe pain

# ■ ACUtE ChESt SYNDROME

Acute  chest  syndrome  (ACS)  is  believed  to  represent  a  combination  of pneumonia,  pulmonary  infarction,  and  pulmonary  emboli  from  necrotic bone marrow. It is a leading cause of death in all patients with SCA, but especially those older than 10 years.

--- Page 477 ---

CHAPTER 84: Sickle Cell Anemia in Children

457

# Clinical Features

Consider ACS in all patients  with  SCA  who  present  with  complaints  of chest pain, especially when associated with tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory distress. Significant hypoxia and rapid deterioration to respiratory failure can occur.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Chest radiographs should be obtained but may be normal during the first hours to days. The diagnosis is made in the setting of a new infiltrate on chest  radiograph  in  the  setting  of  chest  pain  and  respiratory  symptoms. Both pneumonia and acute chest syndrome typically cause leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia may accompany a severe crisis. Sputum and blood cultures  are  rarely  positive.  Pneumonia  is  most  commonly  due  to  atypical bacteria (chlamydia, mycoplasma), but can represent community acquired pathogens  ( Streptococcus  pneumoniae )  as  well. Asthma,  cardiac  volume overload, and, in adulthood, pulmonary hypertension are also commonly associated with SCA.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Because deterioration can be rapid, close monitoring is required, typically in the ICU.

# ■ ACUtE CENtRAL NERVOUS SYStEM EVENtS

# Clinical Features

Consider acute stroke in any patient with SCA who presents with sudden onset  headache  or  neurologic  changes,  including  hemiparesis,  seizures, speech  defects,  visual  disturbances,  transient  ischemic  attacks,  vertigo, cranial nerve palsies, paresthesias, altered mental status or coma. Children with SCA are at significantly higher risk of acute ischemic stroke than unaffected children.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Because of the challenges in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke (e.g., limited availability of MRI, CT negative in acute setting), providers may need to

--- Page 478 ---

458 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

initiate treatment based exclusively on clinical suspicion. As SCA patients age, their risk of a hemorrhagic stroke increases as well, primarily due to aneurysm development. If clinical history is appropriate for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, workup should proceed as for a patient without SCA. Acute chest  crisis,  sudden  severe  anemia,  and  meningitis  can  cause  neurologic symptoms, and appropriate tests should be sent to investigate these possibilities in the appropriate clinical setting.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Suspected  CNS  vasoocclusion  necessitates  immediate  stabilization  and careful  monitoring.  Urgent  exchange  transfusion  is  preferred  to  standard transfusion, and the Hgb should not be raised above 10 g/dL. Transfusion should be initiated with the goal of < 30% HbS. As in any ischemic stroke, temperature, glucose, and oxygenation should be monitored and controlled. Limited data exists regarding the use of alteplase, and it currently has no role in the management of SCA-related ischemic stroke in children. Intracranial  hemorrhage  should  be  managed  in  conjunction  with  a  neurosurgeon. All children with suspected stroke should be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.

# ■ PRIAPISM

# Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Priapism, a painful sustained erection > 4 hours in the absence of sexual stimulation, occurs when sickled cells accumulate in the corpora cavernosa. It  can affect any male with SCA regardless of age, and severe prolonged attacks can cause impotence. Typically, the patient has an edematous and tender penis, with difficulty urinating.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Patients  with  priapism  should  receive  vigorous  oral  or  IV  hydration  and appropriate  analgesia. As  in  non-SCA  priapism,  needle  aspiration  of  the corpora  cavernosa  and  administration  of  a  vasoconstrictor,  such  as 1:1,000,000 epinephrine solution, may be required. Transfusion is not recommended as immediate therapy for priapism. Management and admission decisions should be made promptly in consultation with urology and pediatric hematology.

# ■ hEMAtOLOGICAL CRISES

# Acute Sequestration Crises

# Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Intrasplenic trapping of red blood cells primarily affects children under 5 years of age, but can occur in older patients with combined forms of SCA (e.g., SC disease). Often preceded by a viral syndrome, splenic sequestration presents with sudden-onset left upper quadrant pain; pallor and lethargy;  tender  splenomegaly;  and  progresses  to  hypotension,  shock,  and death. A CBC shows profound anemia, with hemoglobin < 6  g/dL, or > 2  g/ dL lower than the patient's baseline level. Minor episodes can occur with

--- Page 479 ---

CHAPTER 84: Sickle Cell Anemia in Children

459

insidious onset of abdominal pain, slowly progressive splenomegaly, and a more  gradual  fall  in  hemoglobin  level.  Generally  the  hemoglobin  level remains > 6  g/dL.

Patients may have accompanying mild neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Less commonly, sequestration can occur in the liver. Clinical features include  an  enlarged  and  tender  liver  with  associated  hyperbilirubinemia, severe anemia, and elevated reticulocyte count. Cardiovascular collapse is rare in this condition.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Hydration,  PRBC  transfusion,  and  admission  are  required  for  major episodes. Transfusion should be gradual (5 mL/kg), as return of the sequestered  RBCs to the intravascular space can occur, causing hyperviscosity. Occasionally, children with minor episodes can be observed, and discharged with close follow-up with a hematologist.

# ■ APLAStIC EPISODES

Potentially life-threatening aplastic episodes are precipitated primarily by viral infections, typically parvovirus B19, and present with gradual onset of pallor, dyspnea, and fatigue. The CBC shows an unusually low hemoglobin and reticulocyte  count,  with  normal  white  blood  cell  and platelet  counts.  Recovery  is  spontaneous  within  1  to  2  weeks,  and patients can typically be temporized with PRBC transfusion in the ED with  close  outpatient  follow-up  in  7  to  10  days  for  repeat  labs  or inpatient setting.

# ■ hEMOLYtIC CRISES

Bacterial and viral infections in children with SCA can precipitate rapid hemolysis,  with  sudden-onset  of  jaundice  and  pallor.  A  CBC  shows hemoglobin  level  decreased  from  baseline,  with  markedly  increased reticulocytosis.  Specific  therapy  is  rarely  required,  though  transfusion may be helpful in symptomatic patients. Care should be directed toward treating the underlying infection. Close follow-up to monitor hemoglobin level and reticulocyte count should be arranged if discharged from the ED.

# ■ INFECtIONS

# Clinical Features

Poor splenic function renders children with SCA particularly susceptible to bacterial infections, particularly in early childhood. Currently, bacteremia rates are 0.3% to 1.1%.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Risk factors for sepsis in children with SCA include temperature > 40°C, WBC > 30,000 or < 5000 cells/mm 3 , platelet count < 100,000/mm 3 , Hgb < 5  g/dL, ill appearance, and history of pneumococcal sepsis.

--- Page 480 ---

460 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Children with a temperature above 38.5°C meeting any high-risk feature (see above) should have a CBC, blood culture, reticulocyte count, and, if clinically indicated, a urine culture sent and received a parenteral antibiotic with activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae , such as ceftriaxone 50  mg/kg IV or IM, as soon as possible. Vancomycin  should  be  added  if  the  patient  is  at  high  risk  for  penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infection. Septic shock must be managed aggressively with early goal-directed therapy. Patients with any respiratory symptoms should also get a chest radiograph. Well-appearing patients who have reliable nextday follow-up can be discharged following a parenteral dose of ceftriaxone pending culture results. Ill-appearing patients with temperatures > 39.5°C should be admitted.

# ■ VARIANtS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE

Sickle cell trait is the carrier state of SCA (heterozygous). These patients are typically asymptomatic and experience sickling only in the presence of extreme  hypoxia  or  high  altitude.  Baseline  microscopic  hematuria  may exist. Sickle cell -hemoglobin C disease is a heterozygous condition characterized  by  mild  to  moderate  anemia  and  fewer  complications.  However, splenomegaly can persist to adulthood, and these patients remain at risk for sequestration  crises. Sickle  cell β -thalassemia disease  is  a  heterozygous condition with variable severity and symptoms.

Childhood  cancer  is  a  leading  cause  of  death  in  children,  but  with improvements  in  management  and  outcomes,  many  patients  with  new, active, or treated malignancies present to the ED. This chapter covers the most common pediatric malignancies and hematologic issues. More information on malignancy-related complications is provided in Chapter 139 and  hemophilia  and Von Willebrand's  disease  are  discussed  in  detail  in Chapter 135.

# ■ CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy, with a peak incidence between 3 to 5 years of age and a 75% to 80% 5-year survival.

# Clinical Features

Patients can present with systemic complaints (fever, weight loss) or any of the following signs or symptoms of bone marrow or extramedullary infiltration: pallor, fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, fever, or bone pain (particularly nocturnal). Many have hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Rarely, acute myelogenous  leukemia  (AML)  can  present  with  gingival  hyperplasia  or subcutaneous masses (chloromas).

# Diagnosis and Differential

The complete blood count (CBC) with manual differential is the most useful  test,  though  leukocytosis  and  blasts  may  be  absent  early  in  the disease  process,  requiring  close  follow-up  of  patients  with  insidious complaints  such  as  bone  pain.  White  blood  cell  (WBC)  counts  below 4000/mL 3 , mild anemia, and mild thrombocytopenia should raise suspicion in these cases. Abnormalities of two or more cell lines make leukemia more likely. If the CBC is concerning for acute leukemia, obtain a chest  radiograph  (for  mediastinal  mass);  electrolytes  with  creatinine, calcium,  uric  acid,  and  phosphate  (for  evidence  of  tumor  lysis);  liver function tests and lactate dehydrogenase, prothrombin time (PT)/partial prothrombin tine (PTT) (looking for disseminated intravascular coagulation); peripheral smear; type and screen if anemic; and blood and urine cultures if febrile.

The differential diagnosis is extensive depending on the patient's presenting  symptom.  Aplastic  anemia  and  viral  infections  can  cause  bone marrow suppression; rheumatologic diseases can overlap with symptoms and findings of leukemia; and idiopathic immune thrombocytopenia can be difficult to differentiate, though classically involves isolated destruction of the platelets without affecting other cell lines.

# ■ LYMpHOMA

Hodgkin's lymphoma is a lymphoid neoplasm preferentially affecting adolescents.  Most  cases  present  in  the  cervical  or  supraclavicular  lymph  nodes causing  nontender,  nonerythematous,  rubbery  lymphadenopathy  chains. Systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, night sweats, weight loss) occur in 39% to 50% of children and teens. A chest radiograph may demonstrate an anterior mediastinal mass. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can originate in or outside of the  lymphatic system, and occurs across ages, particularly in those with a history of immunosuppression. Because the tumor can occur in any organ, presenting signs and symptoms differ by location. A CBC, electrolytes and creatinine (looking for tumor lysis), and chest radiograph (looking for mediastinal mass) should be performed in the ED. ED care involves management of acute complications, avoidance of steroid therapy except in life-threatening situations, consultation with an oncologist, and recognition of the potential for  intrathoracic  airway  compromise  in  patients  with  a  mediastinal  mass. Compression of the superior vena cava (SVC syndrome) or compression of both SVC and trachea (superior mediastinal syndrome) can occur, with respiratory symptoms, upper body edema, headache, and altered mental status.

# ■ CENtrAL NErVOUS SYStEM tUMOrS

Brain  tumors  are  common  pediatric  malignancies,  and  typically  present with nonspecific symptoms: headaches (especially early morning), irritability, emesis, and behavioral changes related to increased intracranial pressure. In infants, overt signs of increased pressure (e.g., bulging fontanel, sunsetting of eyes) can sometimes be appreciated. Vomiting, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, or vague neurologic signs and symptoms can occur as well. CT scan or  MRI  are  acceptable  imaging  studies  in  the  ED.  Spinal  cord tumors can present with back pain with or without neurological signs and are  evaluated  by  MRI.  Seizures  should  be  treated  if  present,  and dexamethasone (1 mg/yr of age up to 10 mg) can be given to reduce vasogenic edema in patients not suspected to have leukemia or lymphoma. Further management should be determined by oncology and neurosurgery.

# ■ EXtrACrANIAL SOLID tUMOrS

Neuroblastoma is a primitive ganglion tumor that can arise along the sympathetic nervous system, most commonly in the adrenal gland, other abdominal  location,  chest,  or  neck.  Patients  can  present  with  a  painless  mass,

--- Page 484 ---

464

SECTION 9: Pediatrics

hepatomegaly, or symptoms of mass effect from compression of the bowel, bladder, lymphatics, spinal cord, trachea, or superior vena cava. Occasionally, retrobulbar metastasis can cause raccoon eyes and proptosis. Paraneoplastic manifestations can include hypertension, watery diarrhea, and opsoclonusmyoclonus syndrome (rapid, multidirectional eye movements and jerking of the  extremities).  CBC  for  evidence  of  bone  marrow  infiltration  and  chest radiograph for mediastinal mass should be obtained in the ED. Urine levels of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid are helpful diagnostically.

Wilms  tumor ,  or  nephroblastoma,  primarily  affects  young  children ( < 10 years of age) and typically presents with an abdominal mass with few symptoms other than those explained by local compression. Many patients present with lung metastasis or hypertension from increased renin production. These masses can rupture with trauma or vigorous palpation.

Germ cell tumors typically present as masses in the ovary or testicle, although extragonadal locations are common in younger children. They are particularly more common in boys with a history of an undescended testicle. Diagnosis is by ultrasound.

Retinoblastoma is a white-grey intraocular malignancy that typically presents  in  children  less  than  2  years  of  age  with  loss  of  the  normal red reflex (Fig. 85-1). Strabismus, decreased visual acuity, a fixed pupil, glaucoma,  or  an  injected,  painful  eye  are  less  common  presentations.

--- Page 485 ---

CHAPTER 85: Hematologic-Oncologic Emergencies in Children

465

One-quarter of cases are bilateral, and diagnosis is made through ophthalmology consultation and CT scan or MRI.

Bone and tissue sarcomas include rhabdomyosarcoma (a painless tissue mass), osteosarcoma (a bony tumor around the metaphysis of the knee, proximal  humerus,  pelvis,  or  mandible),  and Ewing's  sarcoma (a  bony tumor of the long bones and axial skeleton). Osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma can present as a dull,  aching  pain,  particularly  at  night  or  with activity, a tender mass that seems to appear following a minor trauma, or with systemic symptoms. Diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma is by ultrasound or  CT scan, while osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma often are seen on plain radiograph, with osteosarcoma demonstrating a mixed sclerotic/lytic 'sunburst' appearance of periosteal reaction and Ewing's sarcoma having a destructive, 'moth-eaten' appearance.

# ■ HEMOpHILIA

Hemophilia is an inherited deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B) which can be mild ( > 5% factor activity), moderate (1% to 5% factor activity), or severe ( < 1% factor activity).

# Clinical Features

Appropriate family history or bleeding/bruising out of proportion with injury, recurrent  bleeding,  or  in  bleeding  into  uncommon  locations  (GI,  joints) should raise concern for a bleeding disorder. Common issues in hemophilia are  hemarthroses  (and  resultant  destructive  arthropathy),  muscle  bleeds (occasionally causing compartment syndrome), and intracranial hemorrhage.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Hemophilia causes an elevated PTT, with normal platelets, bleeding time, and PT. Quantitative factor levels are diagnostic. Other bleeding disorders include thrombocytopenias, vitamin K deficiency bleeding (typically 2 to 14 days after birth in neonates whose parents have refused prophylactic vitamin  K  administration  at  birth),  and  von  Willebrand's  disease  (prolonged bleeding in the face of normal platelet numbers with or without factor 8 deficiency).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is with appropriate factor replacement: up to 100% correction with severe bleeds, and less with more minor bleeds.

# ■ ANEMIA

# Clinical Features

Anemia may be asymptomatic or  accompanied  by  pallor  and  fatigue  or heart failure.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Iron deficiency anemia due primarily to excessive cow's milk intake typically affects children aged 6 months to 3 years of age. Children outside of this age range should be assessed for occult GI bleeding with stool guaiac testing.

--- Page 486 ---

466 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

Laboratory studies demonstrate anemia with a low reticulocyte count and low mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Hemolytic anemia can be primary or secondary to an underlying infection or intrinsic disorder. Patients have isolated  anemia  with  high  MCV ,  spherocytes  and  schistocytes  on  peripheral smear, elevated indirect bilirubin, and a positive direct antibody test.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most  asymptomatic  or  minimally  symptomatic  patients  with  iron  deficiency anemia can be safely discharged with careful follow-up, reduction of milk intake below 24 oz/d, and initiation of iron therapy (2 to 3 mg/kg/ dose of elemental iron three times daily). Hemolytic anemia may require more  careful  observation  or  transfusion,  based  on  the  patient's  clinical status and hemoglobin level. Steroids are indicated in the treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. If transfusion  is  required,  patients  with  very low hemoglobin levels ( < 5 g/dL) should receive 3 to 5 mL/kg of PRBCs over 2 to 3 hours to start, while patients with a pretransfusion Hb > 5 g/dL can receive 10 mL/kg to start.

# ■ IDIOpAtHIC tHrOMBOCYtOpENIC pUrpUrA (Itp)

ITP is an autoimmune disorder of platelet destruction.

# Clinical Features

While often an isolated condition in preschool-aged children, ITP can be a feature  of  rheumatologic  disorders  (e.g.,  lupus)  or  infections  (e.g.,  HIV , hepatitis  C),  particularly  in  teens.  Patients  can  present  with  petechiae  or bleeding (nares or gingiva), and, in the younger child without a coexisting condition, ITP often follows a viral infection by days to weeks.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Other autoimmune and infectious disorders (lupus, HIV, hepatitis C) should be  considered,  particularly  in  the  teen.  In  ITP,  other  cell  lines  are  not affected  and  platelets  are  often  below  20,000/mm 3 with  a  large  platelet volume. CBC and blood type should be sent. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemolytic-uremic syndrome should be considered in the ill patient with thrombocytopenia.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

ITP in children carries an excellent prognosis, with 70% resolving spontaneously within 6 months, regardless of treatment. Children with minimal symptoms and platelets > 20,000/mm 3  are often followed without intervention.  For  children  with  significant  bleeding  or  platelet  counts < 20,000/ mm 3 , the following options exist:

--- Page 487 ---

CHAPTER 85: Hematologic-Oncologic Emergencies in Children

467

the RBCs, hemolysis ensues, dropping the Hb 1 to 2 g/dL over the week following treatment. In 2010, a boxed warning was issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in response to hemolysis-related deaths of  primarily  older  adults  following  use  of  WinRho ®   for  ITP,  recommending 8 hours of monitoring for signs of hemolysis (back pain, chills, fever,  discolored  urine)  and  premedication  with  acetaminophen  and diphenhydramine is recommended.

# ■ NEUtrOpENIA

Neutropenia implies a neutrophil count below 1500/mm 3 , but risk of lifethreatening infections increases significantly when the count falls in severe neutropenia ( < 500/mm 3 ).

# Clinical Features

Neutropenia  can  be  asymptomatic  or  associated  with  serious  bacterial illness.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Benign forms of neutropenia include benign transient neutropenia (from viral infections or medications), autoimmune neutropenia, and cyclic neutropenia.  More  serious  forms  of  neutropenia  are  chronic  and  persistent, such as congenital agranulocytosis, or chemotherapy related. Neutropenia can be caused by viral suppression, sepsis-induced bone marrow suppression, medications, isoimmune causes in the neonate, or autoimmune causes (including  cyclic  neutropenia  with  recurrent  4-  to  6-day  episodes  on  a 21-day cycle) in an older child. It is difficult to differentiate benign from serious causes in the ED.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Patients with already diagnosed benign forms of neutropenia and evidence of infection can typically be discharged home, though consultation with the patient's hematologist and a single dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) may be considered depending on the clinical situation. Asymptomatic patients with incidental  neutropenia  should  see  a  hematologist  on  an  outpatient  basis. Febrile  children  with  undifferentiated  or  nonbenign  neutropenia  should have blood cultures sent and broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated.

Renal emergencies in children represent a large and varied group of disease processes. This chapter focuses on common renal emergencies in children, including  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI),  nephrotic  syndrome,  glomerulonephritis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

# ■ ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

Acute kidney injury (AKI), earlier called acute renal failure, is the abrupt loss of renal function resulting in the inability of the body to maintain fluid homeostasis. AKI in children is relatively sporadic and is most often caused by hypoxic injury (e.g., septic shock, dehydration) or nephrotoxins (e.g., antibiotics, contrast dye, NSAIDs).

# Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of AKI depends on the underlying cause, such as bloody  diarrhea  and  abdominal  pain  in  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  or fever, hypotension, and petechiae in sepsis. Ultimately, patients will manifest stigmata of renal failure: nausea and anorexia due to uremia, headache due  to  hypertension,  edema  (periorbital,  scrotal  or  labial,  dependent,  or generalized) resulting in weight gain, and decreased urine output.

# Diagnosis and Differential

AKI  may  be  anatomically  categorized  as  prerenal,  renal  (intrinsic),  or postrenal in etiology (Table 86-1). Elevated creatinine and urine output are used to diagnose AKI. Urinalysis (UA) with microscopy can help distinguish between prerenal and renal AKI. In prerenal AKI, the UA may be normal except for a high specific gravity ( > 1.025). For intrinsic causes

such as acute tubular necrosis, hyaline casts may be seen on UA with a low to normal specific gravity. In glomerulonephritis, UA often shows hematuria, casts, and proteinuria while isolated proteinuria is more indicative of nephrotic syndrome. Basic blood tests such as serum electrolytes (including  sodium and potassium), BUN and creatinine, and a complete blood count (CBC) should be obtained in all cases of AKI to help identify the cause  and  guide  management.  Hyperkalemia  and  other  findings  may require emergency interventions. Additional blood tests may be indicated in specific scenarios.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of AKI is based on the etiology. Goals of treatment include identifying  the  underlying  cause  and  correcting  fluid  and  electrolyte  imbalances.  Life-threatening  complications  such  as  severe  hyperkalemia  or hypertensive  emergency  should  be  addressed  immediately.  A  pediatric nephrologist  should  be  consulted  for  most  cases  of AKI  as  many  cases require inpatient admission.

# ■ NEphROTIC SYNDROME

Nephrotic syndrome is a chronic disease that affects glomerular capillary wall permeability causing urinary protein loss. The hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome  are  significant  proteinuria,  hypoalbuminemia,  hyperlipidemia, and edema.

# Clinical Features

Patients most commonly present with edema, which may involve the face, abdomen, scrotum or labia, or lower extremities. Because periorbital edema is nonspecific, patients are often misdiagnosed as having an allergic reaction. Patients may have foamy or bloody urine. Extreme hypoalbuminemia may cause pleural effusions, bowel wall edema, or ascites. Life-threatening complications of nephrotic syndrome include thromboembolic events (arterial and venous) and severe infections due to an immunocompromised state (due to loss of antibodies).

--- Page 490 ---

470 SECTION 9: Pediatrics

# Diagnosis and Differential

Nephrotic syndrome is classified as primary (only affecting the kidney) or secondary (multisystem disease with renal involvement). Primary nephrotic syndromes  include  minimal  change  disease,  focal  segmental  sclerosis, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative nephritis, and proliferative nephritis (which may be diffuse, focal, or mesangial). Secondary forms of  nephrotic  syndrome  include  lupus,  Henoch-Schönlein  purpura,  sickle cell anemia, and drug or toxin exposure (e.g., heavy metals). TORCH infections may cause congenital nephrotic syndrome.

There are four diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome: (1) hypoproteinemia with albumin level < 3 g/dL, (2) urine protein to creatinine ratio > 2 on first morning void or 24-hour urine protein > 50 mg/kg, (3) hypercholesterolemia ( > 200 mg/dL), and (4) generalized edema. Further testing may  be  required  to  distinguish  primary  from  secondary  nephrotic  syndrome.  Renal  biopsy  is  not  indicated  during  initial  episodes  of  acute nephrotic syndrome.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

In the emergency department (ED), the goal is to treat the acute symptoms. Managing the fluid status of the nephrotic syndrome patient can be challenging since patients may be intravascularly depleted but show signs of fluid overload with significant edema. Treatment principles are as follows:

Many patients with nephrotic syndrome can safely be discharged home on a low-salt diet ( < 2  g/d) with close follow-up with their PCP or nephrologist. Indications for admission include severe edema, thrombotic complications, or signs and symptoms of systemic infection.

# ■ ACUTE GLOMERULONEphRITIS

Acute  glomerulonephritis  (GN)  is  the  result  of  inflammation  leading  to glomerular injury and is characterized by hematuria and proteinuria. Glomerulonephritis  may  be  immune-mediated,  inherited,  or  post-infectious, and  is  classified  as  primary  (isolated  renal  involvement)  or  secondary (resulting from a systemic disorder).

# Clinical Features

Patients  typically  present  with  bloody,  foamy  (from  proteinuria),  or  teacolored urine along with oliguria, fatigue, or lethargy. Severe hypertension may result in headaches. In poststreptococcal GN, there may be a history

CHAPTER 86: Renal Emergencies in Infants and Children

471

of a sore throat, upper respiratory infection (URI), or skin infection preceding the onset of urinary symptoms by 1 to 2 weeks. In IgA nephropathy, children  may  report  a  concurrent  URI  or  URI  symptoms  within  the preceding week.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Common  causes  of  acute  GN  include  post-infectious  etiologies  (poststreptococcal GN), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, and IgA nephropathy. Diagnosis of GN is made by examination of the  urine.  UA  with  microscopy  demonstrates  RBC  casts,  dysmorphic RBCs, and proteinuria. Other laboratory studies  should  include  a  CBC, electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, serum albumin, and urine culture. Serum complement  levels  are  low  in  more  than  90%  of  patients  with  poststreptococcal GN. Streptococcal serologic tests such as antistreptolysin-O and streptozyme may also be helpful.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The  treatment  of  glomerulonephritis  is  determined  by  the  underlying cause.  Treatment  of  post-streptococcal  GN  is  primarily  supportive  as symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks. Depending on the severity of disease, immunosuppressive agents may be used to treat inflammation  and  ACE  inhibitors  may  be  required  to  treat  hypertension, particularly  in  patients  with  proteinuria.  Nephrology  consultation  is indicated  for  patients  with  new-onset  GN.  Patients  with  mild  disease may be discharged home on a fluid-restricted low-sodium diet with close follow-up.

# ■ hEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME

Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia,  and  microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia.  Approximately  90%  of  cases  are  due  to  Shiga-toxin  producing Escherichia  coli O157:H7, found in unpasteurized milk, undercooked meats, and contaminated produce.

# Clinical Features

The majority of patients with HUS present with nausea, vomiting, and bloody  diarrhea.  Within  a  week  of  symptom  onset,  oliguria,  anemia, seizures, and encephalopathy may occur.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of HUS is supported by labs. A CBC will demonstrate a hemoglobin level of 5 to 9 g/dL and platelets < 150,000/mm 3 . Peripheral smear shows schistocytes, helmet cells, and burr cells. A stool specimen to test for Shiga toxin and E. coli O157:H7 should also be sent.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of HUS in the ED is primarily supportive. Hypovolemia should be treated with 10 to 20  mL/kg boluses of normal saline while monitoring for  fluid  overload  in  oliguric  patients.  Platelet  transfusions  are  not

recommended as they increase thrombotic complications. Antibiotics are contraindicated in pediatric diarrheal illnesses as  they  may  increase the risk of HUS. Antiperistaltic agents (e.g., loperamide) are also contraindicated as  they  increase  the  risk  for  systemic  complications  of E. coli infection. All patients with HUS require hospitalization and up to 70% will require dialysis.

# Sexually Transmitted Infections

Jennifer L. Hannum

This  chapter  covers  some  of  the  major  sexually  transmitted  infections that  are  commonly  found  in  the  United  States,  with  the  exception  of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is discussed in Chapter 92. Vaginitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are covered separately in Chapters 63 and 64.

# ■ GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Sexually  transmitted  infections  are  a  major  public  health  problem,  and emergency medicine providers are commonly called upon to identify, treat, and recommend appropriate follow-up for these conditions. Complications from  such  infections  may  contribute  to  infertility,  cancer,  or  urogenital complications. Due to issues with compliance and the challenge of obtaining consistent follow-up care in some communities, single-dose antibiotic treatment  regimens  are  recommended,  when  possible.  Several  of  these infections frequently occur together, and providers should consider additional screening for coexisting infections such as HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis. Test for pregnancy, advise treatment of all recent sexual partners, and counsel  patients  about  the  appropriate  time  frame  for  resuming  sexual contact. Treatment regimens listed here are for adult patients who are not pregnant. Updated treatment recommendations are available on the Centers for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  website  (www.cdc.gov)  and include  specific  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  children  and  pregnant patients.  The  most  recent  full  publication  with  treatment  guidelines  for sexually transmitted infections was issued by the CDC in 2010 and is available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/default.htm.

# ■ CHLAMYDIAL INFECTIONS

# Clinical Features

Chlamydia trachomatis infections in men present with urethritis, epididymitis,  orchitis,  proctitis,  or  Reiter's  syndrome  (nongonococcal  urethritis, conjunctivitis, and rash). Women often have asymptomatic cervicitis, but may  also  present  with  vaginal  discharge,  spotting,  or  dysuria.  Consider

473

--- Page 494 ---

474 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

chlamydial  infection  in  patients  with  sterile  pyuria.  Complications  can include PID, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of chlamydia is best made with indirect detection methods such as  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  or  DNA  probes,  which  have  a sensitivity of 75% to 90%. The CDC recommends a nucleic acid amplification  test  (NAAT)  to  be  used  as  screening  tests  for Chlamydia .  Optimal specimen types for NAAT are vaginal swabs from women and first-catch urine from men.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ GONOCOCCAL INFECTIONS

# Clinical Features

Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes urethritis, epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis in men and urethritis, cervicitis, PID, and infertility in women. Many gonococcal infections in women are asymptomatic and may coexist with chlamydial infection. Women who are symptomatic may present with nonspecific  lower  abdominal  pain  and  mucopurulent  vaginal  discharge  with findings of cervicitis or PID. Men often present with dysuria and purulent penile discharge, but can also present with acute epididymitis, orchitis, or prostatitis. Disseminated gonococcemia may present with fever, rash (tender  pustules  on  a  red  base,  usually  on  the  extremities,  and  may  include palms and soles), tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The CDC recommends NAAT be performed on cervical, vaginal, urethral, or urine specimens. Culture and nucleic acid hybridization tests require endocervical or urethral swab specimens. Diagnosis of disseminated gonorrhea is challenging because cultures of blood, skin lesions, and  joint  fluid  yield  positive  results  in  only  20%  to  50%  of  patients. Culturing  the  cervix,  rectum,  and  pharynx  can  be  considered  for patients  suspected  of  disseminated  disease  to  improve  the  diagnostic yield.

# ■ TRICHOMONIASIS

# Clinical Features

Patients with Trichomonas vaginalis parasite infections can remain asymptomatic or present with a range of symptoms up to severe inflammatory disease. In men this infection is often asymptomatic, but may present as urethritis.  Symptoms in women may include vulvar irritation and a malodorous, thin watery discharge with associated burning, pruritus, dysuria, urinary frequency, dyspareunia, or lower abdominal pain.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Microscopic visualization of the motile Trichomonas vaginalis parasites on a wet preparation of cervical smears or spun urine samples is diagnostic. Motility  is  only  present  for  10  to  20  minutes  after  collection  thereby decreasing sensitivity. Culture is the most sensitive and specific test, but may take up to 7 days. DNA probes and monoclonal antibodies are used at some institutions.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ SYpHILIS

# Clinical Features

Treponema pallidum ,  a  spirochete, causes the three stages of syphilis infections: primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. Primary syphilis is characterized by a chancre (Fig. 87-1), a single painless ulcer with indurated borders that develops on the penis, vulva, or other areas of sexual contact. The primary chancre  heals  and  disappears  after  3  to  6  weeks,  and  the  secondary  stage occurs after several additional weeks. Rash and lymphadenopathy are the most common symptoms of secondary syphilis. The rash consists of nonpruritic dull  red  or  pink  papules  that  begin  on  the  trunk  and  flexor  surfaces  of  the extremities  and  subsequently  spread  to  the  palms  and  soles.  Constitutional

--- Page 496 ---

476

SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

symptoms  such  as  fever,  malaise,  headache,  and  sore  throat  are  common before spontaneous resolution of this second stage. Tertiary or latent syphilis develops in about one-third of patients and can begin 3 to 20 years after the initial  infection.  Involvement  of  the  nervous  system  (meningitis,  dementia, tabes  dorsalis),  cardiovascular  system  (thoracic  aneurysm),  and  widespread granulomatous lesions (gummata) are characteristic of tertiary syphilis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Treponema pallidum cannot  be  cultured  in  the  laboratory  and  testing  is  a challenge because there is no single optimal diagnostic test. The sensitivity and specificity of tests for syphilis depend on the stage of the disease and type of test. Nontreponemal tests such as Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma regain (RPR) detect nonspecific antibodies that are indicative of infection but do not become detectable until 1 to 4 weeks after a chancre appears. Positive results for these screening tests must subsequently be confirmed with an immunoassay specific for T.  pallidum antibodies. A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis is made if a positive result on a nontreponemal antibody test is supported by a positive confirmatory result on a treponemal  antibody  test.  Direct  visualization  of  organisms  using  darkfield microscopy is diagnostic for primary, secondary, or early congenital syphilis.

# ■ HERpES SIMpLEX INFECTIONS

# Clinical Features

Primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection often begins with a viral prodrome lasting 2 to 24 hours that is characterized by localized or regional pain, tingling, and burning. Constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, anorexia, or malaise often follow. Papules and vesicles on an erythematous base appear, with vesicular erosion that occurs over a few hours to several days. In men, painful HSV ulcers often appear on the shaft or glans of the penis (Fig. 87-2), while in

--- Page 498 ---

478 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

women, the painful ulcers occur on the introitus, urethral meatus, labia, and perineum. Viral shedding occurs for 10 to 12 days after the onset of the rash, and lesions heal completely within 3 weeks.

# Diagnosis and Differential

HSV infection is diagnosed based on a characteristic history and associated physical  findings.  Viral  cultures  taken  from  vesicles  or  early  ulcers  are more reliable for confirmation than the classically described Tzanck smear to identify intranuclear inclusions.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ CHANCROID

# Clinical Features

Caused by Haemophilus ducreyi , chancroid presents as a painful erythematous papule at the site of infection. This lesion erodes and becomes ulcerated and pustular over the next 2 days (Fig. 87-3). Up to 50% of patients have more than one lesion, with 'kissing lesions' occurring from autoinoculation of adjacent areas of skin. Painful lymphadenopathy develops 1 to 2 weeks after primary infection, and if treatment is not initiated these lymph nodes become necrotic and infected buboes.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Chancroid is typically diagnosed clinically, with care to consider the diagnoses of syphilis and HSV. Sometimes the organism may be cultured from a swab of an ulcer or bubo, but a special culture medium is required that is not found in many laboratories.

# Toxic Shock Syndromes

Sorabh Khandelwal

# ■ STAPHYLOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME

Staphylococcal  toxic  shock  syndrome  (TSS)  is  a  severe,  life-threatening infection attributed to Staphylococcus aureus that can progress rapidly to multisystem dysfunction, severe electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, and shock. Risk factors for TSS include retained foreign bodies (e.g., tampons, female barrier contraceptives), skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., abscess, cellulitis, and mastitis), varicella infection, sinusitis, surgery, trauma, childbirth, and influenza.

# Clinical Features

TSS is characterized by high fever, profound hypotension, diffuse macular rash, desquamation (1 to 2 weeks after onset of rash), and multiorgan dysfunction. The details regarding the diagnostic criteria for TSS are listed in Table 88-1. Patients presenting early in the course may exhibit nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, headache, sore throat,

vomiting,  diarrhea,  or  abdominal  pain.  The  rash  associated  with  TSS  is described as a 'painless sunburn' that typically fades within 3 days and is followed by full-thickness desquamation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

TSS is a clinical diagnosis characterized by an acute febrile illness associated  with  erythroderma,  hypotension,  and  multiorgan  involvement. Laboratory evaluation reveals evidence of end-organ damage, and testing often includes CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies,  creatine  phosphokinase  level,  urinalysis,  chest  radiograph,  ECG, blood gas, and cultures of blood and other potential sites of infection. Other infections to consider in the differential diagnosis of TSS include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), myonecrosis due to Clostridium  perfringens ,  TSS  due  to Clostridium  sordellii ,  staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, sepsis due to other bacterial organisms, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, leptospirosis, and meningococcemia. Noninfectious  illnesses  such  as  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  toxic  epidermal necrolysis, and Kawasaki's disease may also be considered in the proper clinical circumstances.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

TSS  is  mediated  by  pyrogenic  exotoxins  released  by  certain  strains  of S. aureus , and initial management includes aggressive resuscitation to treat shock and begin treating potential sources of infection. Abscesses should be  drained,  foreign  bodies  should  be  removed,  surgical  consultation should be considered for debridement of infected tissue, and appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended.

# ■ STREPTOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME

STSS is a clinical illness characterized by shock and multiorgan failure as a result of invasive infection due to group A Streptococcus ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) and other streptococcal pathogens. Risk factors for STSS include the presence of underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart, liver, and kidney disease, diabetes, alcoholism, drug abuse, surgical procedures, traumatic injuries, childbirth, varicella infection, and influenza.

--- Page 502 ---

482 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

# Clinical Features

Similar to TSS, fulminant STSS is often preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, sweats, malaise, arthralgias, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  or  diarrhea. A rash  is  seen  in  a  minority  of  cases.  Pain  at  a  localized  site,  often  an extremity or abdomen, that is out of proportion to physical findings is a common presentation of STSS due to the strong association of STSS and necrotizing soft tissue infections. Diagnostic criteria for fulminant STSS are listed in Table 88-2.

# Diagnosis and Differential

STSS is a clinical diagnosis characterized by an acute febrile illness associated with hypotension and multiorgan involvement in the setting of a streptococcal infection. Laboratory evaluation is similar to TSS (see above) and findings identify evidence of end-organ damage. The differential diagnosis includes many of the same disease processes as TSS (see above).

# Sepsis

John E. Gough

Sepsis is generally defined as a suspected or confirmed infection with evidence of systemic inflammation. Severe sepsis is sepsis with evidence of new organ dysfunction thought to be secondary to tissue hypoperfusion. Septic  shock  is  present  when  cardiovascular  failure  occurs,  reflected  by persistent hypotension or the need for vasopressors despite adequate fluid resuscitation. The majority of sepsis cases are caused by gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria; however,  sepsis  is a  heterogeneous  clinical syndrome  that  can  be  caused  by  any  class  of  microorganism  including fungi,  mycobacteria,  viruses,  rickettsiae,  and  protozoa.  The  most  likely microorganisms that cause sepsis varies based on possible patient exposure to  drug-resistant  microorganisms  (e.g.,  due  to  recent  hospitalization  or other  health  care-associated  exposure)  and  the  specific  anatomic  site  of suspected  infection.  Pneumonia,  intraabdominal  infection,  urinary  tract infection, and skin or soft tissue infections are the most common infections that precipitate sepsis.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The  presence  of  sepsis  may  be  apparent  on  the  initial  presentation  of  a critically ill patient. In some cases, however, sepsis can be challenging to identify early in a patient's evaluation. Abnormal vital signs such as hyperthermia  or  hypothermia,  tachycardia,  hypotension,  and  tachypnea  may suggest sepsis as a diagnostic possibility in the right clinical circumstances. In  particular,  up  to  40%  of  patients  who  present  with  undifferentiated hypotension are later diagnosed with septic shock when a source of infection is identified through diagnostic testing.

Traditionally sepsis has been categorized as a type of distributive shock associated with peripheral vasodilation, warm extremities, and a compensatory increase in cardiac output. However, this does not accurately reflect the presentation of all patients with sepsis. The combination of intravascular volume depletion and septic cardiomyopathy may also manifest as 'cold shock,' with impaired peripheral perfusion and cool extremities.

Many different abnormalities are possible with severe sepsis, reflecting different areas of end-organ damage. Severe sepsis is the leading cause of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Widespread  inflammation  secondary  to  sepsis  commonly  affects  pulmonary function  even  in  the  absence  of  pneumonia.  Refractory  hypoxemia, decreased  lung  compliance,  and  a  chest  x-ray  demonstrating  bilateral pulmonary  alveolar  infiltrates  are  commonly  found  with  ARDS.  Renal manifestations of severe sepsis include acute renal failure with azotemia, oliguria, and anuria. The most frequent hepatic abnormality is cholestatic jaundice and is associated with elevation in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and/or bilirubin. The most frequent hematologic changes associated  with  sepsis  are  neutropenia  or  neutrophilia,  thrombocytopenia,  and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Hyperglycemia may develop,

484

--- Page 505 ---

CHAPTER 89: Sepsis

485

and uncontrolled hyperglycemia is a significant risk for adverse outcome. Cutaneous  lesions  that  occur  as  a  result  of  sepsis  can  be  divided  into five categories: direct bacterial involvement of the skin and underlying soft tissues  (cellulitis,  erysipelas,  and  fasciitis);  lesions  from  hematogenous seeding of the skin or the underlying tissue (petechiae, pustules, cellulitis, ecthyma  gangrenosum);  lesions  resulting  from  hypotension  and/or  DIC (acrocyanosis  and  necrosis  of  peripheral  tissues);  lesions  secondary  to intravascular infections (microemboli and/or immune complex vasculitis); and lesions caused by toxins (toxic shock syndrome).

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Consider the possibility of sepsis in patients who present with criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), as detailed in Table 89-1. Severe  sepsis  involves  these  criteria  plus  evidence  of  organ  dysfunction such  as  hypotension,  elevated  serum  lactate  level,  renal  dysfunction, hypoxia,  hyperbilirubinemia,  thrombocytopenia,  or  coagulopathy.  Septic shock involves refractory hypotension, and does not typically reverse with rapid volume replacement of at least 1.5 to 3.0 L of isotonic crystalloid (or 20  to  30  mL/kg  in  children).  History  and  physical  examination  findings combined  with  initial  laboratory  and  radiolographic  investigations  often identify a presumptive infection source for sepsis, which can guide empiric therapy.  Focus  particular  attention  to  signs  and  symptoms  of  potential infections in the central nervous system, pulmonary system, intraabdominal structures, urinary tract, skin, and soft tissues.

Initial laboratory studies for patients with suspected sepsis often include a CBC with differential and platelet count, lactic acid level, serum electrolytes, liver function panel, renal function panel, arterial blood gas analysis, blood  cultures,  urinalysis,  and  urine  culture.  Consider  type  and  crossmatching blood for patients with acute anemia or refractory hypotension who may need emergent transfusion. A chest x-ray can assess for pneumonia  as  a  potential  source  of  infection. Additional  radiographs,  CT  scans, ultrasound, or lumbar puncture may be utilized in specific patients based on clinical  suspicion  for  potential  infectious  sources.  Other  laboratory  tests for  markers of sepsis may be considered, such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Studies have shown that the cornerstones of the initial treatment and stabilization  of  severe  sepsis  are  early  recognition,  early  reversal  of  hemodynamic compromise, and early empiric antibiotics for infection control. The goals of resuscitation are to improve preload, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.

Skin and soft tissue infections are common, and their successful evaluation and  management  involve  an  understanding  of  disease  severity.  Infection and patient characteristics help guide appropriate antibiotic treatment, outpatient or inpatient options, and potential surgical therapy.

# ■ METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS

Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of soft tissue infections in adults and children. Understanding treatment guidelines for community-acquired MRSA is important for managing soft tissue infections in the ED.

# Clinical Features

Community-acquired MRSA causes skin lesions that are typically warm, red, tender, and commonly associated with soft tissue abscesses that may be  spontaneously  draining.  MRSA  lesions  are  frequently  mistaken  as spider bites.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  of  MRSA  is  typically  made  based  on  clinical  features. Consider  the  likelihood  of  community-acquired  MRSA  for  soft  tissue infection where S. aureus or Streptococcus are typically considered common etiologic pathogens. This includes skin and soft tissue infections as well  as  sepsis  and  pneumonia.  Bedside  ultrasound  may  be  helpful  to identify  abscess  collections  in  cases  where  physical  examination  is equivocal.

# ■ NECROTIZING SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are aggressive and potentially life threatening infections. These infections can present with an insidious onset and early findings may appear deceptively benign. Necrotizing soft tissue infections  represent  a  spectrum  of  conditions  that  may  be  polymicrobial  or monomicrobial. Group A Streptococcus and S.  aureus are  often  the  etiologic  agents  in  monomicrobial  infections.  Clostridial  infections  are  now uncommon secondary to improved hygiene and sanitation.

# Clinical Features

Patients present with pain out of proportion to physical findings and a sense of heaviness in the affected part. Physical findings may include a combination  of  edema,  brownish  skin  discoloration,  bullae,  malodorous  serosanguineous discharge, and crepitus. Patients may have low-grade fever and associated tachycardia out of proportion to the fever. Mental status changes, including delirium and irritability, may accompany necrotizing soft tissue infections and are signs of systemic toxicity.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Familiarity with the disease and an appreciation for subtle physical findings early in its development are important factors in making the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections. Additional findings that may supplement clinical suspicion include gas within soft tissue on plain radiographs, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, myoglobinuria, and renal or hepatic dysfunction.

immunoglobulin remain controversial and may be considered in consultation with surgical colleagues.

# ■ CELLULITIS

Cellulitis is a subset of soft tissue infections characterized by a local soft tissue inflammatory response caused by bacterial invasion of the skin. This infection  is  more  common  in  the  elderly,  immunocompromised  patients, and patients with peripheral vascular disease.

# Clinical Features

Cellulitis presents as localized tenderness, erythema, and induration of the skin. Lymphangitis and lymphadenitis can accompany cellulitis and may indicate a more severe infection. Patients may present with associated fever and chills.

# Diagnosis and Differential

History  and  physical  examination  are  often  sufficient  to  make  the  clinical diagnosis of cellulitis. Obtaining a white cell count or blood cultures rarely changes management of otherwise healthy patients with uncomplicated cellulitis. Cellulitis of the lower extremity may sometimes mimic or be complicated  by  deep  venous  thrombosis,  and  clinical  uncertainty  may  prompt additional studies to evaluate for this possibility. In patients with signs of systemic toxicity, consider additional evaluation for an occult abscess using bedside ultrasound and/or cultures of blood and other suspected areas of infection.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ERYSIpELAS

Erysipelas is a superficial cellulitis with associated lymphatic involvement and is caused primarily by group A Streptococcus . Infection is often associated with an initial portal of entry or break in the skin.

--- Page 514 ---

494 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

# Clinical Features

Onset  of  this  infection  is  often  acute  and  characterized  by  sudden  high fever, chills, malaise, and nausea. Over 1 to 2 days, a small area of erythema with a burning sensation develops. The erythema of erysipelas is sharply demarcated from surrounding skin and is tense and painful. Lymphangitis and lymphadenitis are common.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  is  based  primarily  on  physical  findings  and  history. Although  leukocytosis  is  common,  white  blood  cell  counts,  cultures, ASO titers, and anti-DNase B titers are of limited use in an acute care setting.  Differential  diagnosis  includes  other  forms  of  local  cellulitis. Consider surgical consultation for patients with bullae, crepitus, pain out of proportion to examination, or rapidly progressing erythema with signs of systemic toxicity, as these signs and symptoms may suggest necrotizing infection.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Guidelines  no  longer  differentiate  the  treatment  of  nonpurulent  cellulitis from erysipelas. Patients with uncomplicated erysipelas can be treated with antibiotics as detailed above for cellulitis.

# ■ CUTANEOUS ABSCESSES

Cutaneous skin abscesses are frequently the result of a breakdown in the cutaneous  barrier,  with  a  subsequent  focal  infection  caused  by  resident bacterial flora. Incision and drainage is often the only necessary treatment for simple skin abscesses.

# Clinical Features and Diagnosis

Patients  present  with  an  area  of  swelling,  tenderness,  and  overlying  erythema.  The  area  of  swelling  is  often  fluctuant.  Cutaneous  abscesses  are usually well-localized infections, although they may cause systemic toxicity in immunosuppressed patients. Evaluate cutaneous abscesses for predisposing injury  or  foreign  bodies.  Needle  aspiration  or  bedside  ultrasound may be useful when it is unclear whether a patient has an abscess or cellulitis. There are several common abscess types with unique managements discussed below.

mucosal surface of the abscess, generally followed by the insertion of a Word catheter. The Word catheter can be left in place for up to 4 weeks. Sitz baths are recommended after 2 days. Follow-up with gynecology is recommended  within  2  days  in  patients  with  severe  symptoms  and within 1 week in patients with mild symptoms.

# ■ SpOROTRICHOSIS

Sporotrichosis is caused by traumatic inoculation of the fungus Sporothrix schenckii , which is commonly found on plants and in the soil.

# Clinical Features

After a 3-week incubation period, three types of infection may occur. The fixed  cutaneous  type  of  infection  occurs  at  the  site  of  inoculation  and looks like a crusted ulcer or verrucous plaque. The local cutaneous type also  remains  at  the  site  of  inoculation  but  presents  as  a  subcutaneous nodule or pustule with surrounding erythema. The lymphocutaneous type is the most common of the three and presents as a painless nodule at the site  of  inoculation  with  subcutaneous  nodules  that  migrate  along  lymphatic channels.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of sporotrichosis is based on the history and physical examination. Tissue biopsy cultures are often diagnostic but of limited use in the acute care setting. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, tularemia,  cat-scratch  disease,  leishmaniasis,  nocardiosis,  and  staphylococcal lymphangitis.

Viral illnesses are among the most common reasons that people come to an emergency  department.  Although  many  viral  illnesses  are  self-limited, some can be life-threatening, have specific treatments, or have public health implications. This chapter reviews some of the more common specific viral infections.

# ■ INFLUENZA

Influenza infections occur worldwide with peak activity found in temperate climates between late December and early March. Influenza virus is transmitted by aerosolized or droplet transmission from the respiratory tract of infected persons or by direct contact. After exposure, the incubation period is about 1 to 4 days, and viral shedding begins 24 hours before the onset of symptoms.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms of influenza are often abrupt in onset and include fever with chills  or  rigors,  headache,  myalgia,  and  generalized  malaise. Additional symptoms may include cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and tender, enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Elderly patients may not have classic symptoms and can present with only fever, malaise, confusion, and/or nasal congestion. Almost  50%  of  affected  children  have  associated  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  but  these  are  unusual  in  adults.  Fever  generally  lasts  2  to  4  days, followed  by  recovery  from  most  of  the  systemic  symptoms  within  3  to 7 days. Cough and malaise may persist for several weeks.

Respiratory complications of acute infection include primary influenza pneumonitis, secondary bacterial pneumonia, croup, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Avoid aspirin use in patients with suspected  or  confirmed  influenza  due  to  an  association  with  Reye's syndrome.  Other  uncommon  complications  include  Guillain-Barré  syndrome, myocarditis, and pericarditis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A clinical diagnosis of influenza during a known outbreak can be made using  history  and  physical  examination.  Rapid  antigen  assays  can  give results within 15 minutes but have variable sensitivity (10% to 80%) that can result in higher levels of false-negative results when influenza activity is high. Although specificity is high (90% to 95%), false-positive results can  also  occur,  especially  when  influenza  activity  is  low.  Molecular diagnostic  tests  are  available  and  are  more  sensitive  and  specific  than antigen tests.

During influenza season, consider diagnostic testing in the outpatient setting for immunocompetent patients at high risk for influenza complications  and  within  5  days  of  symptom  onset,  and  in  immunocompromised patients regardless of time since illness onset. Many hospitals implement

497

--- Page 518 ---

498 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

protocols for influenza testing of patients admitted with respiratory disease. Once  influenza  has  been  documented  in  the  local  community,  influenza testing  is  not  typically  indicated  for  otherwise  healthy  outpatients  with signs and symptoms consistent with influenza, especially during the peak of activity.

# ■ hErpES SIMpLEX VIrUS

Transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) occurs by contact of mucous membranes  or  open  skin  with  infected  bodily  fluids  from  patients  with ulcerative lesions or infected individuals who are shedding the virus without overt disease.

# Clinical Features

HSV-1  infection  most  commonly  results  in  orolabial  lesions,  whereas HSV-2 is most often found in genital herpes. Primary HSV infections typically produce more extensive lesions involving mucosal and extramucosal sites, often accompanied by systemic signs and symptoms. Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis for 1 to 2 weeks are typical manifestations of primary HSV-1  infection,  and  these  lesions  are  small  thin-walled  vesicles  on  an erythematous  base  within  the  mouth.  In  children  younger  than  5  years, lesions can be associated with fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Recurrent HSV-1 infections are typically milder and present as herpes labialis on the lower lip at the outer vermilion border.

--- Page 519 ---

CHAPTER 91: Serious Viral Infections

499

Less common manifestations of HSV infection include herpetic whitlow on a finger or herpes gladiatorum elsewhere on the body in wrestlers and  other  athletes  involved  in  close  contact  sports.  Herpetic  keratitis presents as a painful, red eye, and can be identified by characteristic dendritic lesions on fluorescein slit lamp exam. Either HSV-1 or HSV-2 can cause genital lesions, and while genital HSV-2 is more common and has a higher relapse rate, the proportion of genital disease caused by HSV-1 is increasing.

HSV infection within the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most common viral causes of encephalitis in the United States. This occurs most  commonly  in  patients  between  20  and  50  years  of  age  and  HSV encephalitis carries a mortality rate > 70% if left untreated. HSV encephalitis is associated with fever and neurologic symptoms such as focal motor or cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, seizures, altered mental status, or behavioral  abnormalities.  Meningitis  can  occur  in  up  to  25%  of  females  with primary  HSV-2  infections,  although  this  typically  has  a  benign  course. HSV infections in immunocompromised hosts can lead to widespread dissemination with multi-organ involvement.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  and  initial  treatment  of  suspected  HSV  infection  is  often based on clinical findings, as confirmatory testing may take days or weeks before  results  are  available.  Because  mucocutaneous  HSV  infection  is  a lifelong condition, laboratory testing is often recommended for confirmation. Viral culture can be obtained from an unroofed vesicle, or polymerase chain reaction or direct fluorescent antibody testing can be performed on swabbed tissue. A Tzanck test is generally not useful.

Consider  the  possibility  of  HSV  infection  in  patients  with  suspected infection  of  the  CNS,  particularly  in  patients  with  altered  mental  status, cognitive  deficits,  psychiatric  symptoms,  or  seizures  (see  Chapter  148, 'Central Nervous System and Spinal Infections'). Temporal lobe lesions on CT scan or MRI are suggestive of HSV encephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may demonstrate a lymphocytic pleocytosis and/or erythrocytosis. PCR testing of spinal fluid is the testing modality of choice for HSV when suspected, and the viral DNA can be detected within the first 24 hours, with results remaining positive for a week or longer.

500 mg every 12 hours for 3 days (genital), or famciclovir 1500 mg for one  dose  (orolabial)  or  1000  mg  for  one  dose  (genital).  Less  severe outbreaks may be treated with topical 5% acyclovir ointment applied six times per day for 7 days.

# ■ VArICELLA AND hErpES ZOStEr

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the causative organism for both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) infections. Herpes zoster is reactivation of the latent virus within a dorsal root ganglion that can occur with a waning immune response due to advancing age or immunosuppression. The presence of herpes zoster in an otherwise young and healthy person may be a sign of HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorder.

# Clinical Features

Primary varicella infection is a febrile illness with a superficial vesicular rash that appears in crops and is concentrated on the torso and face. Lesions are typically at varying stages of development, including papules, vesicles, and crusted lesions. Headache, malaise, and loss of appetite are often present. Most infections are minor and self-limited with lesions crusting over and sloughing off after 1 to 2 weeks. Varicella is contagious until all of the lesions have crusted over.

Complications are more common in very young and very old patients and those with immunocompromise. Bacterial infections of skin lesions, often with group A streptococci, can cause serious illnesses including necrotizing fasciitis. CNS complications such as cerebellar ataxia, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis have been described. Infection of cerebral arteries resulting in vasculopathy and stroke may also occur. Pneumonitis can be severe and is more common in pregnant women.

Herpes  zoster  causes  lesions  similar  to  those  of  a  primary  varicella infection but that occur in a unilateral and dermatomal distribution on the skin. A prodrome of malaise, headache, and photophobia may occur with localized pain, itching, and parasthesias preceding the outbreak of the rash. Although any dermatomal level may be affected, involvement of the trigeminal  or  thoracic  dermatomes  are  common.  Ocular  involvement  with herpes zoster ophthalmicus may occur when the ophthalmic distribution of the trigeminal nerve is involved (see Chapter 149, 'Ocular Emergencies'), and is associated with zoster lesions on the tip or side of the nose (Hutchinson's sign). Consider ophthalmology consultation when these are present or a patient has facial lesions with associated eye symptoms.

Herpes zoster lesions typically last about 2 weeks but may persist for a month. Postherpetic neuralgia is pain that continues 30 days after the initial eruption and occurs more often with advancing age. Rash involving multiple dermatomes or crossing the midline may represent disseminated disease,  which  can  occur  in  immunocompromised  patients  when  the  virus spreads to visceral organs to cause pneumonitis, hepatitis, or encephalitis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Most cases of varicella infection can be diagnosed with history and physical examination findings. Laboratory diagnosis with viral culture, antigen

testing, or PCR testing of vesicle fluid may be appropriate in patients with atypical illness or severe disease. Although smallpox has been eradicated, it remains a potential threat as a biologic weapon, and the lesions could be confused with those of varicella. The lesions of smallpox are larger, distributed more on the extremities, and all lesions are at the same stage of development. Obtain a chest radiograph if pneumonitis is suspected. Consider advanced testing when CNS infection is suspected, which may include an MRI of the brain, lumbar puncture, and/or PCR testing.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ EpStEIN-BArr VIrUS INFECtION

Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV)  is  the  causative  agent  of  heterophile-positive infectious mononeucleosis. EBV infection is also associated with cancers such  as  B-cell  lymphoma,  Hodgkin's  disease,  Burkitt's  lymphoma,  and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

# Clinical Features

Transmission of EBV is via salivary secretions. Close contact is required for transmission, often from an asymptomatic individual. Clinical manifestations  depend  on  age  and  immune  status  with  peaks  of  infection  in early  childhood  and  young  adulthood.  Infants  and  young  children  are often asymptomatic or have only mild pharyngitis. Teenagers and young adults can develop infectious mononucleosis, which presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis with tonsillar exudates. Splenomegaly occurs  in  more  than  half  of  patients.  Symptoms  generally  resolve  over 2 to 3 weeks, and most patients recover uneventfully.

Epstein-Barr virus can affect nearly all organ systems. Neurologic complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been described. Hepatitis, myocarditis, and hematologic disorders are

--- Page 522 ---

502 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

also known complications. Rarely death results from splenic rupture, CNS complications, and airway obstruction.

# Diagnosis and Differential

When infectious mononeucleosis is suspected based on history and physical  exam,  consider  a  CBC  and  a  monospot  test  to  provide  confirmation, when indicated. Lymphocytosis with > 50% lymphocytes and presence of atypical  lymphocytes are suggestive of the diagnosis. The monospot test may be negative early in the course of disease, and repeat testing later in the course of illness may be helpful when the diagnosis remains uncertain.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ MEASLES

Measles is caused by an RNA virus that is highly infectious and is communicable  before  symptoms  begin.  Measles  outbreaks  have  occurred recently in communities where children are not appropriately vaccinated.

# Clinical Features

Acute measles infection occurs with fever, malaise, cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis.  Small,  white  Koplik's  spots  appear  on  the  buccal  mucosa early  in  the  illness,  followed  by  a  red  maculopapular  rash  that  typically begins on the head and spreads throughout the body.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of measles is typically made based on clinical findings such as the pathognomonic Koplik's spots and characteristic rash. Confirmatory testing can be done by detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ArBOVIrAL INFECtIONS

Arboviral  infections  are  spread  by  mosquito,  tick,  and  fly  bites  with increased incidence in warmer months due to the breeding patterns of these arthropod  vectors.  West  Nile  virus  and  the  viruses  that  cause  La  Cross

503

encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and western  equine  encephalitis  are  found  in  North  America.  Other  significant arboviral diseases are discussed in Chapter 98, 'World Travelers.'

# Clinical Features

Most arbovirus infections are either asymptomatic or cause a nonspecific mild  illness.  Only  a  few  infected  individuals  will  develop  hemorrhagic fever  or  encephalitis.  Severe  human  arboviral  diseases  most  commonly manifest as one of four syndromes: fever and myalgia, arthritis and rash, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. Headache is a common symptom of most arboviral infections. Hemorrhagic fever presents with bleeding from the gums, petechiae, and the gastrointestinal tract. The classic presentation of viral encephalitis is fever, headache, and altered level of consciousness.  Patients  can  be  lethargic  and  confused,  and  occasionally  present with seizures.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Obtaining a detailed travel and exposure history and knowing local epidemiologic patterns can help when arboviral infections are suspected. Consider neuroimaging as a component of hospitalization for patients diagnosed with encephalitis, recognizing that MRI is more sensitive and may show foci  of  increased  signal  intensity.  Cerebrospinal  fluid  typically  shows  a lymphocytic  pleocytosis  and  a  slightly  elevated  protein  level,  although these findings are nonspecific. Serologic testing is the primary method for confirming arboviral infections.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ EBOLA VIrUS AND OthEr hEMOrrhAGIC FEVErS

Viral hemorrhagic fevers are rare diseases that can elicit tremendous fear among the public and health care providers, exemplified by the large Ebola virus  outbreak  in  West  Africa  in  2014.  Other  examples  of  hemorrhagic fever include hantavirus pulmonary syndromes and Lassa fever.

# Clinical Features

Viral infections leading to hemorrhagic fever illnesses typically begin with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and malaise. Progression of disease leads to gastrointestinal and other organ system involvement, where increased  vascular  permeability  leads  to  hypotension,  pulmonary  edema, and renal failure. Abnormalities in the coagulation pathways lead to diffuse hemorrhage with extensive bleeding, organ dysfunction, and shock.

--- Page 524 ---

504 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

# Diagnosis and Differential

Travel to endemic areas of the world and/or contact with a known infected traveler are important clues when suspecting Ebola or other hemorrhagic fever illnesses. Confirm these rare infections using acute serologic testing to identify antibodies or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the  virus.  These  tests  are  typically  performed  at  specialized  laboratories such as the CDC.

# HIV Infection and AIDS

Sarah Battistich

The  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV)  and  Acquired  Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) remain a major cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide.  Despite  decades  of  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  advances, increased life expectancies from highly active antriretrovirals are in general limited to high-income industrialized countries, and morbidity and mortality around the world remains high. The pandemic continues to significantly impact  affect  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  heterosexual  transmission  is common and as many as 1 in 20 individuals live with HIV and AIDS. In the United  States,  there  are  approximately  50,000  new  cases  annually,  with higher  incidences  in  men  who  have  sex  with  men  and  young  minority populations.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Human immunodeficiency virus is a cytopathic retrovirus that selectively attacks host cells involved in immune function, primarily CD4 + T  cells. Infection ultimately results in persistent defects in cellular immunity which permit the development of opportunistic infections and neoplasms. Up to 90% of newly infected individuals have symptoms at the time of an acute HIV infection, most commonly nonspecific influenza-like symptoms that can go unrecognized. Symptoms usually develop 2 to 4 weeks after exposure, and can last for 2 to 10 weeks. The most common symptoms include fever ( > 90%), fatigue (70% to 90%), sore throat ( > 70%), rash (40% to 80%), headache (30% to 80%), and lymphadenopathy (40% to 70%).

Seroconversion,  which  occurs  when  there  is  a  detectable  antibody response  to  HIV,  usually  occurs  3  to  8  weeks  after  infection,  although delays of up to 11 months have been reported. This is followed by a long period of asymptomatic infection. The mean incubation time from exposure to the development of AIDS in untreated patients is 8 years in adults and 2 years in children under 5 years of age.

Early  symptomatic  infection,  when  CD4  cell  counts  are  200  to 500 cells/mm 3 ,  is  characterized by conditions that are more common and more severe in the presence of HIV infection but are not AIDS-defining conditions. Examples include thrush, persistent vulvovaginal candidiasis, peripheral  neuropathy,  cervical  dysplasia,  recurrent  herpes  zoster,  and idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura.  As  the  CD4  count  drops  below 200 cells/mm 3 , the frequency of opportunistic infections increases. AIDS is defined by the appearance of any indicator condition (Table 92-1) or a CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm 3 . Late symptomatic or advanced HIV infection exists in patients with a CD4 count lower than 50 cells/mm 3  or clinical evidence  of  end-stage  disease,  including  disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) or disseminated Cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Antiretroviral  regimens  are  effective  in  suppressing  viral  loads  and maintaining normal CD4 counts, which has favorably changed the longterm prognosis and impact of HIV infection for patients who take these

medications. Access  to  medical  care,  patient  compliance,  and  financial resources to obtain medications are identified barriers to effective treatment in many parts of the world.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

HIV infection can be diagnosed by identifying HIV nucleic acid, detecting viral-specific antigen, detecting antibodies to HIV, or isolating the virus by culture.  Mean times from transmission to detection are shortest for viral load (17 days), followed by p24 antigen (22 days), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positivity (25 days), and Western blot positivity (31 days). Although viral load assays are not always available in the ED, rapid tests for  the  detection  of  the  p24  viral  antigen  enable  earlier  detection  of infection than relying on the development of antibody response alone. The current recommended testing method is detection of antibodies to HIV-1/2 combined with detection of the viral-specific p24 antigen.

Although acute HIV infection is not diagnosed in up to 75% of cases, benefits  of  early  detection  include  the  opportunity  to  limit  transmission to  others  and  for  individuals  to  start  antiretroviral  medications  early.

--- Page 527 ---

CHAPTER 92: HIV Infection and AIDS

507

The spectrum of disease caused by HIV infection varies, from those with asymptomatic infection to those seeking care from involvement of any organ system. In the assessment of patients with known HIV , knowledge of recent CD4 count and HIV viral load can help with management, as CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm 3  and viral load greater than 50,000 copies/mL are associated with an increased risk of AIDS-defining illness. When these levels are unavailable, a total lymphocyte count of < 1700 cells/mm 3  is strongly predictive of a CD4 count of < 200 cells/mm 3 .

# Febrile Illness

Systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise are common in HIV-infected patients and account for the majority of HIV-related ED presentations.  Laboratory  investigation  may  include  electrolytes,  complete blood count, blood cultures, urinalysis and culture, liver function tests, and chest radiographs in the appropriate clinical settings. Selected patients may benefit from specific serologic testing for syphilis, cryptococcosis,  toxoplasmosis,  cytomegalovirus  (CMV),  and  coccidioidomycosis. Consider lumbar puncture after neuroimagingwhen CNS infection is suspected.

In  HIV  patients  without  specific  signs  or  symptoms  to  localize  the source of fever, common causes can vary by stage of disease. Patients with CD4 counts higher than 500 cells/mm 3  generally have febrile illnesses from sources similar to those in nonimmunocompromised patients. Those with CD4 counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm 3  are more likely to have bacterial  respiratory  infections.  For  patients  with  CD4  counts  lower  than 200  cells/mm 3 ,  infections  without  localizing  symptoms  or  findings  can include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), CMV, drug fever, and sinusitis.  Other  causes  may  include  endocarditis  (see  Chapter  93), lymphoma, Histoplasma capsulatum , and Cryptococcus neoformans . Fever caused by the primary HIV infection itself tends to occur in the afternoon or evening and is generally responsive to antipyretics.

Immune  reconstitution  inflammatory  syndrome  mimics  an  autoimmune event, with fever, lymphadenitis, and systemic symptoms that begin weeks to months after starting antiretroviral treatment and often associated with tuberculosis therapy. This rarely requires cessation of medications, but suspected cases should be discussed with an infectious disease specialist.

CMV is a common cause of serious opportunistic viral disease in HIVinfected  patients. The  most  important  manifestation  is  retinitis,  which  can often be diagnosed via clinical evaluation. Disseminated disease commonly involves the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and central nervous systems and a specific  diagnosis  may require a tissue biopsy with histologic evidence of viral inclusions and inflammation. Cultures, antigen-based tests, and nucleic acid testing can be used to confirm CMV infection.

Disseminated MAC occurs predominately in patients with CD4 counts below 100 cells/mm 3 who are not on antiretroviral medications. Persistent fever and night sweats are typical, often with weight loss, diarrhea, malaise, and anorexia. Diagnosis is made with acid-fast stain of stool or other body fluids  or  culture.  Treatment  reduces  bacteremia  and  improves  symptoms but does not completely eradicate the infection.

# Pulmonary Complications

Pulmonary presentations are among the most common reasons for ED visits by HIV-infected patients. Bacterial pneumonia outnumbers opportunistic infections, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is  the most common cause  of  pneumonia  in  HIV-infected  patients  in  the  United  States  and Western Europe. Productive cough, leukocytosis, and the presence of a focal infiltrate suggest bacterial pneumonia. Common HIV-related causes of  pulmonary  abnormalities  include  PCP,  TB,  CMV, C.  neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum , and neoplasms. Evaluation may include pulse oximetry,  arterial  blood  gas  analysis,  sputum  culture  and  Gram  stain, acid-fast stain, blood cultures, and chest radiography.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is the most frequent opportunistic infection, and the most common identifiable cause of death among AIDS patients in the United States. The symptoms of PCP are often insidious, and  include  fever,  nonproductive  cough,  and  progressive  shortness  of breath.  Chest  radiographs  typically  demonstrate  diffuse  interstitial infiltrates,  although  negative  radiographs  are  reported  in  up  to  20%  of patients. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, although nonspecific, are often  seen.  Hypoxia at  rest  or  with  exertion  and  an  increased  alveolararterial oxygen gradient can identify patients at risk, and a presumptive diagnosis of PCP may be made in the setting of unexplained hypoxemia. Definitive diagnosis often requires bronchoscopy.

TB frequently occurs in patients  with  CD4 T-cell  counts  of  200  to 500  cells/mm 3 .  Consider  TB  in  HIV-infected  patients  with  pulmonary symptoms,  and  initiate  appropriate  respiratory  isolation.  As  HIVinfection progresses, many patients do not report classic manifestations of TB such as cough with hemoptysis, night sweats, prolonged fevers, weight loss, and anorexia. Classic upper lobe involvement and cavitary lesions  are  less  common,  particularly  among  late-stage AIDS patients. False-negative  purified  protein  derivative  TB  test  results  are  frequent among AIDS patients due to immunosuppression. Late-stage HIV is also associated  with  extrapulmonary  tuberculosis,  typically  within  lymph nodes, bone marrow, CNS, GI, and urogenital systems.

Consider  disseminated  fungal  infections  such  as C.  neoformans and Aspergillus  fumigatus in  severely  immunosuppressed  patients.  Noninfectious causes of pulmonary complaints such as neoplasms and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis may also occur.

# Neurologic Complications

Neurologic  disease  may  be  caused  by  a  variety  of  opportunistic  infections, neoplasms, the HIV virus itself, or even as a side effect of antiretroviral treatment. Headaches, seizures, altered mental status, meningismus, or focal neurologic deficits can be caused by AIDS dementia, Toxoplasma gondii ,  or C. neoformans .  Consider neuroimaging and lumbar puncture for patients with CD4 < 200 and neurologic deficits or headaches. Initial neuroimaging with a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan is appropriate, while a contrast-enhanced CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)  may  also  be  considered  in  appropriate  clinical  circumstances. When obtaining cerebrospinal fluid, measure an opening pressure and order a complete cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, India

ink stain, bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures, toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus antigen, and coccidioidomycosis titer.

AIDS dementia complex is a progressive process heralded by gradual impairment of recent memory and other cognitive deficits caused by direct HIV infection. Less common CNS infections that may present with neurologic symptoms include bacterial meningitis, histoplasmosis, CMV , progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy,  herpes  simplex  virus,  neurosyphilis, and TB. HIV patients may experience HIV neuropathy characterized by painful sensory symptoms of the feet.

# Ophthalmologic Manifestations

CMV retinitis is the most frequent and serious ocular infection and the leading cause of blindness in AIDS patients. Early infection may be asymptomatic, but may progress to changes in visual acuity, visual field abnormalities, photophobia, scotoma, eye redness, or pain. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is another diagnosis to consider and is recognized by the typical zoster rash in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of cranial nerve V .

# Gastrointestinal Complications

Diarrhea is the most frequent gastrointestinal complaint and is estimated to occur in 50% to 90% of AIDS patients. Common causes include bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi, and side effects of antiviral therapy. In many cases, a causative organism is never found. Evaluate stool for leukocytes, ova, and parasites, and consider obtaining acid-fast staining and bacterial culture. If bacterial infection is suspected, treat empirically with ciprofloxacin to cover common  enteric  pathogens. Cryptosporidium and Isospora are  common parasitic  causes  of  diffuse  watery  diarrhea,  and  both  can  be  identified  by acid-fast staining of a stool specimen. In late-stage AIDS, the most common diarrheal pathogens are MAC and CMV, each requiring biopsy for diagnosis.

Oral candidiasis affects  more  than  80%  of AIDS patients  and  can  be identified by its classic appearance of white plaques easily scraped from an erythematous  base.  Esophageal  involvement  may  occur  with Candida , herpes simplex, and CMV. Complaints of odynophagia or dysphagia are usually  indicative  of  esophagitis  and  may  be  extremely  debilitating  and may lead to malnutrition.

Hepatomegaly  with  elevated  alkaline  phosphatase  occurs  in  approximately 50% of AIDS patients. Co-infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C is common, especially among IV drug users.

Anorectal disease is common in AIDS patients. Proctitis is characterized by  painful  defecation,  rectal  discharge,  and  tenesmus.  Common  causative organisms include Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Chlamydia trachomatis , syphilis, and herpes simplex.

# Cutaneous Manifestations

Generalized conditions such as xerosis, seborrheic eczema, and pruritus are common. Kaposi sarcoma is a rash characterized by painless, raised, nonblanching brown-black or purple papules and nodules and is more common in homosexual men with HIV infection. Common sites are the face, chest, genitals,  and  oral  cavity.  Reactivation  of  varicella-zoster  virus  is  more common  in  patients  with  HIV  infection  and  AIDS  than  in  the  general population. Herpes simplex virus infections are common. HIV patients may

develop bullous impetigo and Pseudomonasassociated chronic ulcerations. Bacterial skin infections, scabies, human papillomavirus, and hypersensitivity reactions to medications are also common.

Infective endocarditis is caused by infection and damage to the endocardium of the heart and carries a high morbidity and mortality. This condition is  more  common  in  patients  with  prosthetic  heart  valves,  congenital  or acquired structural abnormalities of the heart or valves, or risk factors such as injection drug use, implanted intravascular devices, poor dental hygiene, HIV, or chronic hemodialysis.

Staphylococcus species are the most common cause of infective endocarditis in patients with either native or prosthetic heart valves. Streptococcus and Enterococcus species are other common infections associated with this condition. Endocarditis with negative blood cultures and no identified causative organism occurs in about 5% of patients. The mitral valve is the most commonly affected valve, followed by aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonic in  order  of  decreasing  frequency.  Infective  endocarditis  associated  with injection drug use has a predilection for right-sided valvular lesions.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Patients present with symptoms along a continuum, from the fulminant and acute onset of disease associated with fever, a new heart murmur, and acute heart  failure,  to  insidious  and  indolent  symptoms  such  as  malaise  and fatigue  in  a  patient  with  a  prosthetic  valve.  Fever  is  the  most  common symptom (80%) followed by chills, weakness, and dyspnea (40%). Other nonspecific  symptoms  include  anorexia,  cough,  and  malaise.  The  most common findings on physical examination include fever and a heart murmur. Classic skin findings such as tender nodules on pads of fingers and toes  (Osler's  nodes),  painless  hemorrhagic  plaques  on  fingers  and  toes (Janeway lesions), petechiae, and splinter hemorrhages occur in less than 50% of cases.

Patients often present with cardiac, neurologic, and embolic complications. Acute heart failure occurs in approximately 70% of patients due to distortion or perforation of valves or cardiac chambers, or rupture of chordae  tendinae.  Other  less  frequent  cardiac  manifestations  include  heart blocks and dysrhythmias. Neurologic complications occur in 20% to 40% of patients, including ischemic stroke, brain abscess, cerebral hemorrhage, mycotic aneurysm, or seizure. Other embolic events may occur in the lungs, spleen, intestines, kidneys, and can cause acute limb ischemia.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Infective endocarditis is difficult to definitively diagnose in the emergency department, given the necessary components for diagnosis are blood culture results, echocardiography, and clinical observation. Consider the diagnosis in patients with unexplained fever and risk factors for the disease, such as injection drug users, patients with prosthetic valves, and those with new or changing murmurs or evidence of arterial emboli. The Duke criteria have long been used to make the diagnosis as detailed in Tables 93-1 and 93-2.

# ■ TETANUS

Tetanus is an acute and frequently fatal disease resulting from an infection with the organism Clostridium tetani . The disease is exotoxin mediated and can occur after any of a variety of tissue injuries, including clean and contaminated wounds, elective surgery, burns, puncture wounds, otitis media, dental infections, animal bites, abortion, and pregnancy. Due to successful vaccination campaigns, tetanus is a rare disease in developed countries but remains a significant problem elsewhere in the world.

# Clinical Features

C.  tetani is  prevalent  throughout  the  environment  in  soil,  dust,  skin  surfaces,  and  animal  and  human  feces.  Spores  are  resistant  to  destruction, survive years on environmental surfaces, and are introduced into the body following tissue injury. Anaerobic tissue conditions lead to toxin formation when the spores begin to germinate, and therefore crushed or devitalized tissue, a retained foreign body, or infection can favor growth of the toxinproducing form of C. tetani . The incubation period ranges from < 24 hours to > 1 month, and while most cases occur within 14 days some patients may present several months after injury. Many cases of tetatnus occur in patients where no specific injury is recognized, and injuries are often minor and occur indoors.

Clinically, tetanus is categorized into three forms: local, cephalic, and generalized. Local tetanus is uncommon and presents with persistent muscle  contractions  in  proximity  to  the  injury  site.  Cephalic  tetanus  is  rare, occurs occasionally with otitis media or head injuries, and has localized involvement of the face and cranial nerves. Generalized tetanus is the most common form (80% of cases) and often presents with a descending pattern of symptoms that begin with pain and stiffness in the jaw. Progression of the symptoms leads to trismus (lockjaw) and development of the classically described  facial  expression, risus  sardonicus .  Violent  spasms  and  tonic contractions  of  muscle  groups  are  responsible  for  the  symptoms  of  the disease including dysphagia, opisthotonos, flexing of the arms, fist clenching, rigidity of abdominal muscles, and extension of the lower extremities. Autonomic symptoms include fever, sweating, hypertension, and tachycardia. Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus and can occur due to inadequate  maternal  immunization  and  poor  umbilical  cord  care,  with symptoms typically presenting by the second week of life and associated with an extremely high mortality rate.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Tetanus  is  diagnosed  clinically,  and  early  symptoms  may  include  trismus, neck stiffness or sore throat, and dysphagia. The tetanospasmin toxin interferes with central and peripheral nervous system inhibitory pathways leading

517

--- Page 538 ---

518

SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

to unopposed muscle contraction, seizures, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Prior immunization does not eliminate tetanus as a diagnostic possibility. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests. Other potential diagnoses with muscular contraction or other symptoms that may be similar to tetatnus  include  strychnine  poisoning,  dystonic  reactions  to  phenothiazine, hypocalcemic tetany, rabies, peritonsillar abscess, peritonitis, and meningitis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ rABIES

Infection with the rabies virus leads to a fatal encephalitis in humans and animals,  and  is  most  often  transmitted  by  contact  with  infected  animal saliva via a bite or scratch wound. While most emergency physicians never encounter  patients  suffering  from  acute  rabies  encephalitis,  it  is  very

--- Page 539 ---

CHAPTER 94: Tetanus and Rabies

519

common for patients to present for evaluation and treatment after animal bites or other potential exposures to the rabies virus. In the United States, dog bites, cat bites, and exposure to bats are common reasons that patients present for postexposure prophylaxis. Rabies cases in animals within the United States are most often found in raccoons, bats, skunks, foxes, cats, dogs, and cattle. Ferrets, rabbits, guinea pigs, and squirrels are generally not known to transmit rabies to humans and thus these kinds of exposures are considered very low risk for rabies transmission and providers should contact local public health authorities if there are concerns about how to manage these low-risk exposures.

# Clinical Features

Typical  incubation  periods  for  rabies  virus  infections  are  from  20  to 90  days.  However,  incubation  periods  as  short  as  4  days  or  as  long  as 6 years have been reported, emphasizing the importance of postexposure prophylaxis for patients regardless of the amount of time that has elapsed since  a  suspected  exposure.  The  natural  history  of  clinical  rabies  in humans is presented in Table 94 -1 .

The viral prodrome associated with human rabies infection includes nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, lethargy, headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and pain at the site of a bite wound. Encephalitic rabies (80% of cases) is characterized by episodic hyperexcitability, disorientation,  hallucinations,  and  bizarre  behavior  and  is  associated  with  autonomic  dysfunction,  hypersalivation,  hyperthermia,  tachycardia,  and cardiac arrhythmias. Paralytic rabies (20% of cases) generally begins with

progressively worsening extremity paresis and bilateral facial weakness and progresses to coma and organ failure.

Rabies  infections  lead  to  coma  within  10  days  of  onset.  The  clinical course  is  characterized  by  complications  such  as  pituitary  dysfunction, seizures,  respiratory  dysfunction,  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  autonomic  dysfunction, renal failure, and secondary bacterial infections. Almost all rabies infections are fatal with only a few case reports of patient survival.

# Diagnosis and Differential

During the incubation period for rabies infection, there are no definitive diagnostic tests to confirm infection. The diagnosis of rabies infection is therefore clinical, and may be considered for a patient with an unexplained and  rapidly  progressive  encephalitis,  especially  if  autonomic  instability, dysphagia, hydrophobia or neurologic symptoms are present. Once symptoms are present, antigen and antibody testing of serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, and/or tissue biopsies can detect evidence of rabies infection. CSF analysis often demonstrates pleocytosis with a mononuclear predominance. The  final  diagnosis  of  rabies  is  made  by  postmortem  analysis  of brain tissue.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

For the rare patient who presents with an acute rabies infection and symptoms of clinical disease, there are no specific therapies that have demonstrated clinical benefit. Treatment of an active clinical rabies infection is supportive care with admission to a critical care environment where treatment of the associated complications and further diagnostic testing can be completed.

The more typical focus for emergency providers is to assess patients with possible exposure to the rabies virus, manage public health and animal control notification, and appropriately administer postexposure prophylaxis for rabies exposures.

Malaria, a protozoan disease transmitted by the bite of the Anopheles mosquito, is caused by the genus Plasmodium .  Five species of the protozoan Plasmodium infect humans: P. falciparum , P. vivax , P. ovale , P. malariae , and P. knowlesi . Consider malaria in patients who have recently traveled to endemic areas and present with an unexplained febrile illness.

Malaria transmission occurs in large areas of Central and South America, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania (e.g. , New Guinea, Solomon Islands). More than 50% of malaria cases in the United States, including most cases due to P.  falciparum ,  arise  from  travel  to  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Resistance  of P. falciparum to chloroquine and other drugs continues to spread and strains of P. vivax with chloroquine resistance have also been identified.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Plasmodial  sporozoites  first  infect  the  liver,  where  asexual  reproduction occurs  in  the  exoerythrocytic  stage.  During  this  initial  incubation  stage, which usually lasts 1 to 4 weeks, patients are often asymptomatic. Partial chemoprophylaxis  or  incomplete  immunity  can  prolong  the  incubation period to months or even years. The clinical signs of malaria first appear during  the  erythrocytic  stage,  which  occurs  when  hepatocyte  rupture releases merozoites to invade erythrocytes. In P. vivax and P. ovale infection, a portion of the intrahepatic forms are not released, but remain dormant as hypnozoites, which can reactivate a malaria infection after months or years.

Early symptoms of malaria are nonspecific, including fever, chills, malaise,  myalgias,  and  headache.  Chest  pain,  cough,  abdominal  pain,  or arthralgias may also be seen. Patients then develop a high fever, followed by  diaphoresis  and  exhaustion  when  fever  abates.  Classically,  cycles  of fever and chills followed by profuse diaphoresis and exhaustion occur at regular  intervals,  reflecting  the  ongoing  and  intermittent  hemolysis  of infected erythrocytes.

Physical examination findings are nonspecific. During a febrile paroxysm,  most  patients  appear  acutely  ill,  with  high  fever,  tachycardia,  and tachypnea.  Splenomegaly  and  abdominal  tenderness  are  common.  In P.  falciparum infections,  hepatomegaly, edema, and scleral icterus often occur.

Infections caused by any species of Plasmodium can result in hemolysis with anemia, splenic enlargement, and potential splenic rupture. Severe or complicated  malaria  infections  may  also  occur,  and  are  usually  due  to P.  falciparum .  Prostration,  severe  anemia,  acidosis,  hypoglycemia,  acute renal  failure,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  pulmonary  edema, jaundice, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur in severe infections. Cerebral malaria is characterized by somnolence, coma, delirium, and seizures. In 2011, 22% of malaria cases imported to the United States were classified as severe. Blackwater fever is a severe complication

seen almost exclusively in P. falciparum infections, with massive intravascular hemolysis, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  diagnosis  of  malaria  relies  on  a  history  of  potential  exposure  in  an endemic  area,  along  with  clinical  symptoms,  signs,  and  microscopic examination of thick and thin blood films. A thin blood film is used for counting heavy infections, while a thick blood film detects lower levels of parasitemia. In early infection, especially with P. falciparum ,  parasitemia may be initially  undetectable  due  to  hepatic  sequestration  of  organisms. Parasite load in the peripheral circulation fluctuates over time and is highest during an acute rising fever with chills. Initiate appropriate therapy when malaria is suspected, even if the parasite is not detected on initial blood smears.  If  plasmodia  are  not  initially  visualized  and  malaria  is  a  likely diagnosis,  repeat  blood  smears  at  least  twice  daily  (preferably  during febrile episodes) as long as malaria is suspected or until the patient recovers.  Once  plasmodia  are  identified,  the  smear  can  further  determine  the percentage  of  red  blood  cells  infected  (which  correlates  with  prognosis) and species type (in particular P. falciparum ). Newer techniques for rapid diagnosis and speciation are also available. Sensitivity of such rapid tests is excellent for P.  falciparum with high parasitemia levels, but poor for the other forms of malaria.

Nonspecific laboratory findings may include normochromic normocytic anemia with findings suggestive of hemolysis, a normal or mildly depressed total leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and mild abnormalities of liver and renal functions.

# Foodborne and Waterborne Diseases

Benjamin Weston

Foodborne disease may occur after consumption of food contaminated with bacteria, viruses, parasites, chemicals, or biotoxins. Viruses such as norovirus,  astrovirus,  rotavirus,  and  enteric  adenovirus  are  the  most  common sources, with norovirus causing over half of all cases. Bacterial disease is often more severe and includes nontyphoidal Salmonella , which is the most common cause for hospitalization and associated death in the United States. Other  bacterial  causes  may  include Clostridium  perfringens , Campylobacter spp. , Listeria monocytogenes , Shigella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli, and Staphylococcus  aureus .  Parasitic  causes  include Giardia lamblia , Toxoplasma gondii, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium. In addition, patients may experience symptoms of scombroid or ciguatera poisoning after eating some types of fish associated with these toxin-induced syndromes.

Waterborne diseases occur from ingestion or contact with contaminated water. Symptoms are most commonly gastrointestinal or dermatologic in nature. Common organisms include those associated with foodborne illness as  well  as Vibrio species, Aeromonas species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Yersinia species,  hepatitis  A,  nontuberculous Mycobacterium, and  other less common organisms. The most common pathogen responsible for recreational waterborne disease outbreaks is Cryptosporidium .

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Symptoms of both foodborne and ingested waterborne illness include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, dehydration, and malaise. A history of multiple family members or closely associated individuals with  simultaneous  symptoms  is  supportive  of  a  suspected  foodborne  or ingested waterborne illness. Physical exam may reveal findings of dehydration, and some patients will have stool positive for frank or occult blood. Prolonged illness beyond two weeks suggests protozoan parasites. Shigatoxin  producing Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli) infections  may  present  with vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and mild fever, and may be  complicated  by  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome,  especially  if  antibiotic treatment is prescribed.

Patients  with  scombroid  fish  or  ciguatera  poisoning  have  symptoms similar to other foodborne illnesses and typically present one to six hours after ingestion. In addition to nausea and vomiting, patients with scombroid poisoning frequently have flushing and headache due to a histaminemediated reaction. Those with ciguatera poisoning may have headaches, muscle aches, paresthesias, reversal of hot and cold sensation, or sensitivity  to  extreme  temperatures,  due  to  sodium  channel-mediated  nerve depolarizations.

The skin manifestations of waterborne illness may include localized cellulitis,  painful  indurated  plaques  of Mycobacterium  marinum ,  or

527

--- Page 548 ---

528

SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

necrotizing  infections  and  hemorrhagic  bulla  associated  with Vibrio vulnificus . Patients with Aeromonas hydrophila skin infections often have a  history  of  trauma  associated  with  freshwater  exposure,  and  may have foul smelling wounds.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Diagnostic testing is often not indicated as most of these illnesses are self-limited.  For  those  patients  who  are  more  acutely  ill,  or  if  other significant diagnoses are being entertained, consider stool cultures with Gram  stain,  the  neutrophil  marker  lactoferrin,  electrolytes,  and  complete blood count. Fecal leukocyte testing is neither sensitive nor specific  for  invasive  disease,  and  is  a  poor  predictor  of  response  to antibiotic treatment. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and Vibrio cultures may  require  specific  laboratory  procedures  (check  local  laboratory guidelines).  Reserve  ova  and  parasite  testing  for  those  patients  with symptoms  over  two  weeks,  immunocompromise,  community  waterborne outbreaks, recent travel to endemic areas, or men who have sex with men. Clostridium difficile antigen testing may be indicated in those with prolonged symptoms, recent antibiotic use, significant comorbidities, or extremes of age. Likely pathogens to consider in the differential can  often  be  identified  based  on  clinical  features  of  the  presenting illness (Table 96-1).

Zoonotic infections are a class of specific diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. Transmission  may  occur  via  direct  contact  with  an  infected  animal  or  animal product, by ingestion of contaminated water or food products, by inhalation, or through arthropod vectors-most commonly ticks. Diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms (e.g., fever, headache,  and  myalgias)  which  overlap  with  the  presentation  of  many other infectious and autoimmune diseases. Consider zoonotic infections in patients presenting with viral-like illnesses in conjunction with occupational or geographical risk factors for zoonotic disease exposure and transmission.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii ,  a  pleomorphic obligate intracellular organism. The primary vectors for transmission are the American dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ), Rocky Mountain wood tick ( Dermacentor andersoni ) and the brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ). Most cases occur between April  and  September  with  peak  occurrences  in  June  and  July.  While

cases have been reported in the majority of the continental United States, more than 60% have originated from five states: North Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas.

# Clinical Features

Early findings of RMSF include fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise. Patients  may  also  present  with  lymphadenopathy,  nausea,  vomiting,  and diarrhea. In some patients, particularly children, abdominal pain and edema may  be  present.  Late  in  the  disease  course,  complications  may  include meningitis, encephalitis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and myocarditis.

The classic clinical triad for RMSF of fever, rash, and history of tick bite is uncommon as only about 50% of infected patients can recall a tick bite and the rash is absent in about 10% of cases. When the rash does occur, it typically develops 2 to 4 days after the onset of fever as a maculopapular eruption that may subsequently become petechial. Rash often appears on the ankles and wrists and then spreads centripetally to the trunk, usually sparing the face, and characteristically involves the palms and soles.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  of  RMSF  is  largely  clinical,  with  confirmation  coming after treatment is initiated. In the absence of an alternative explanation, consider the possibility of RMSF in a febrile patient with a headache who lives in or recently traveled through an endemic region in the spring or summer seasons with possible exposure to ticks. Laboratory abnormalities are usually nonspecific, but RMSF is suggested by the combination of normal white and red cells, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests,  and hyponatremia. RMSF can be confirmed-typically outside of the emergency department setting-with a rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera or via skin biopsy of the rash with immunofluorescence testing.

The differential diagnosis for patients with symptoms of RMSF includes viral  illnesses,  pneumonia,  meningococcemia,  ehrlichiosis,  Kawasaki's disease, toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever, and leptospirosis.

# ■ LYMe DISeaSe

Lyme disease remains the most common vector-borne zoonotic infection in the United States. The responsible organism is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and  the  vector  is  the Ixodes deer  tick  (also  known  as  the

--- Page 555 ---

CHAPTER 97: Zoonotic Infections

535

black-legged tick ). In highly endemic areas, the transmission rate from a deer tick bite is about 3%, although there is minimal risk if the duration of attachment is < 36 hours. Cases have been reported in all 48 continental states, but 95% of cases originate from 13 states in the northeast and northern  midwest  with  peak  disease  transmission  in  May  through August.

# Clinical Features

Lyme disease is typically divided into three distinct stages although some patients may not progress through all stages, and stages may overlap or be separated by periods of remission. The first stage involves early localized disease and is characterized by the rash of erythema migrans which may be in  conjunction  with  nonspecific  constitutional  and  rheumatologic  symptoms. The characteristic rash occurs within 2 to 30 days in 60% to 80% of cases,  often  begins  at  the  site  of  the  tick  bite,  and  manifests  as  an  erythematous plaque with central clearing. Other associated symptoms in the first stage of lyme disease include fatigue, headache, fever, neck stiffness, myalgias, arthralgias, and adenopathy.

The second  stage,  early  disseminated  disease ,  occurs  within  a  few days  to  6  months  after  initial  infection.  This  stage  is  characterized  by multiple secondary annular target-shaped skin lesions, fever, adenopathy, neuropathies,  cardiac  abnormalities,  and  arthritic  problems.  Approximately 15% of untreated patients develop neurologic complications such as  cranial  neuritis  that  may  lead  to  the  classically  described  bilateral facial  nerve  palsy.  Other  neurologic  manifestations  include  headache, neck  stiffness,  difficulty  with  mentation,  cerebellar  ataxia,  myelitis, encephalitis, motor or sensory radiculoneuritis, and mononeuritis multiplex. Oligoarticular arthritis can occur, usually affecting the large joints such as the knees. In 8% of patients, there are cardiac manifestations such as  myopericarditis  or  varying  degrees  of  atrioventricular  (AV)  block, which sometimes can require a temporary pacemaker for stabilization.

The third stage, late disseminated disease , occurs months to years after initial  infection.  It  can  be  characterized by chronic arthritis, myocarditis, subacute encephalopathy, axonal polyneuropathy, and leukoencephalopathy. Symptoms can persist for a decade or more.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Initial  diagnosis  of  Lyme  disease  is  based  primarily  on  clinical  features. Confirmation may be obtained via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, polyvalent fluorescence immunoassay, or western immunoblot testing. Differential  diagnosis  depends  on  clinical  manifestation  of  the  disease stage, and may include southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), cellulitis,  erythema multiforme, tinea corporis, viral or bacterial meningitis, encephalitis,  rheumatic  fever,  septic  arthritis,  endocarditis,  and  other inflammatory or autoimmune conditions.

50 mg/kg/d divided three times a day in children, or cefuroxime 500 mg PO  twice  a  day  in  adults,  30  mg/kg/d  divided  three  times  a  day  in children. Macrolides are less effective.

# ■ ehrLIChIOSIS

Ehrlichiosis is a group of zoonotic diseases caused by infection from the Ehrlichia genus. These are small, gram-negative pleomorphic coccobacilli that infect circulating leukocytes. The lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) serves as the primary vector while the white-tailed deer is the major animal reservoir in the southeastern United States.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite. Clinical manifestations  may  include  fever,  headache,  malaise,  nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and arthralgias. Fever is present in a majority of cases (97%). A rash of variable appearance may be present but is not common. A minority  of  patients  progress  to  serious  complications  that  may include renal failure, respiratory failure, and encephalitis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis initially must be made on clinical grounds. Laboratory clues may include  leukocytopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  elevation  of  hepatic enzymes. During the first week of illness, a peripheral blood smear may show  colonies  of  bacteria  in  the  white  blood  cells  in  20%  of  infected patients.  PCR  offers  a  specific  test  for  confirmation  but  is  not  sensitive enough to be used to exclude illness based only on a negative result. An increase in antibody titer between the acute and convalescent phases of the illness  may be used for diagnosis. The gold standard for diagnosis is an immunofluorescence assay.

The  differential  diagnosis  includes  RMSF,  Lyme  disease,  babesiosis, anaplasmosis, viral illnesses, cholecystitis/cholangitis, malaria, meningitis, and typhoid.

# ■ tULareMIa

Tularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis , a small, gram-negative, nonmotile  intracellular  coccobacillus.  The  zoonotic  vectors  are  ticks  of  the Dermacentor (wood tick, dog tick) and Amblyomma (lone star tick) species. The principal animal reservoirs include rabbits, hares, and deer. Methods of transmission include tick or fly bites, inhalation, and direct inoculation of broken skin or mucosa from the handling of infected animals.

# Clinical Features

Clinical features at presentation depend on the route of inoculation. The most common ulceroglandular form is characterized by a maculopapular lesion that ulcerates at the site of a tick bite or wound inoculation, followed by painful regional adenopathy and systemic symptoms. Glandular tularemia consists of tender regional adenopathy without ulceration. The typhoidal form has the highest morbidity and complications such as organ failure, and it presents with fever, chills, headache, and abdominal pain. Ocular-oropharyngeal and pneumonic forms  of  the  disease  result  from airborne deposition into the eyes and lungs.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Laboratory findings are nonspecific in all forms of tularemia. Diagnosis can be determined by culture, direct fluorescent antibody, or PCR from specimens obtained by skin lesion swabs, lymph node sampling, or sputum. The multiple clinical variations of tularemia lead to a broad differential  diagnosis  that  include  pyogenic  bacterial  infection,  syphilis, anthrax, plague, Q fever, psittacosis, typhoid, brucellosis, and rickettsial infection.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ aNthraX

Anthrax  is  an  acute  bacterial  infection  caused  by Bacillus  anthracis ,  an aerobic gram-positive rod that forms central oval spores. Human infection can result from inhalation of spores, inoculation of broken skin, bites from arthropods (fleas), or ingestion of inadequately cooked meat that is infected with the organism.

# Clinical Features

Inhaled or pulmonic anthrax usually results from handling unsterilized, imported animal hides, or imported raw wool. It results in a mediastinitis, rather  than  a  true  pneumonia,  and  is  almost  always  fatal.  Initial

--- Page 558 ---

538 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

presentation  consists  of  flu-like  symptoms,  which  progress  over  2  to 3  days  to  include  marked  mediastinal  and  hilar  edema  and  respiratory failure. Cutaneous anthrax ( woolsorter's disease ) accounts for 95% of all anthrax infections and begins with a pruritic macule at the inoculation site (most commonly fingers) that then progresses to an ulcerative lesion with multiple infectious serosanguinous vesicles containing the anthrax bacillus. The ulcer eventually progresses to a painless black eschar and falls off within 2 weeks. A small minority of untreated patients develop rapidly fatal bacteremia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Gram stain, direct fluorescent antibody stain, or culture of skin lesions or fluid from vesicles may establish the diagnosis. Blood cultures may also be positive. The differential diagnosis for inhalational anthrax includes influenza, tuberculosis, and other causes of mediastinitis (bacterial, viral, parasitic,  sarcoidosis).  With  symptoms  suspicious  for  cutaneous  anthrax, warfarin necrosis, calciphylaxis, ischemic necrosis, tularemia, plague, spider/insect bite, mycobacterial infection, ecthyma gangrenosum, and aspergillosis/mucormycosis may also be considered.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ pLaGUe

Plague  is  caused  by Yersinia  pestis ,  which  is  a  gram-negative  aerobic bacillus. In the United States, it is found most often in rock squirrels and ground rodents of the southwest. The rodent flea serves as the primary vector. Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of an infected flea, consuming infected animals, or inhalation of animal secretions.

--- Page 559 ---

CHAPTER 97: Zoonotic Infections

539

# Clinical Features

An eschar frequently develops at the site of the flea bite and is followed by  the  development  of  an  enlarged,  suppurative,  proximal  lymph  node known as a bubo. Sepsis and pneumonia may develop due to hematologic spread of the bacteria. Bubonic plague often presents with fever, headache, and buboes, while the pneumonic form of the disease is typically associated with cough, chills, dyspnea, and shock. The pneumonic form of the plague is highly contagious and can be transmitted from person to person via aerosolized respiratory secretions and can be rapidly fatal if not treated aggressively.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of plague is typically made based on clinical findings in a patient with possible contact with a vector or animal host. Blood culture or culture of suspected sites may reveal organisms, but treatment should be initiated in suspected cases without awaiting culture results. The differential diagnosis includes lymphogranuloma venereum, syphilis, staphylococcal or streptococcal lymphadenitis, other causes of pneumonia, or tularemia.

# World Travelers

Bret A. Nicks

Patients returning from travel abroad may present with fever or other symptoms  of  infection.  The  evaluation  of  a  potential  infectious  disease  in  a returning traveler requires an understanding of the geographical distribution  of  infections  (Table  98-1),  risk  factors,  incubation  periods,  clinical manifestations, and appropriate laboratory investigations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website provides additional health information  for  travelers  based  on  specific  locations  around  the  world: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list/.  Some  specific  disease  processes are covered elsewhere in this book: traveler's diarrhea, enteroviral infections,  gastroenteritis,  giardiasis,  salmonellosis,  and  shigellosis  are discussed in Chapters 37 and 96, anthrax and plague are discussed in Chapter 97, and malaria is discussed in Chapter 95. This chapter covers some of the other common infectious diseases that may present in patients returning from travel outside of the United States.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The incubation periods for many diseases are commonly longer than an individual traveler's foreign stay, and therefore travelers who are exposed to infectious diseases often develop symptoms of disease after they return from travel. Ask patients about visits to game parks, farms, caves, health facilities,  consumption  of  exotic  foods,  activities  involving  fresh  or  salt water exposure, insect exposure, sexual activities, reported epidemics in the area visited, contact with ill people, and any pre-trip immunizations and prophylactic antibiotics that have been taken. Determine the chronological history of disease progression, including details about the quality, severity, duration, and episodic nature of fever and chills. When completing a complete history and physical examination, note the presence of any

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Evaluate the results of laboratory studies to assess for abnormalities suggestive of specific disease processes. On a CBC with differential, look for lymphopenia (dengue, HIV, typhoid), eosinophilia  (parasites,  fungal  disease),  or  thrombocytopenia  (malaria,  dengue,  acute  HIV ,  typhoid).  Consider a blood smear and dipstick antigen test for malaria, if available, for travelers with fever who have recently visited endemic locations. Urinalysis may show proteinuria and hematuria in cases of leptospirosis. Obtain liver function tests if physical examination identifies jaundice. Consider testing for specific diseases suspected by symptoms and risk of exposure. Obtain a chest radiograph when respiratory symptoms are present, and consider a liver ultrasound if amoebic liver abscess is suspected.

Management of patients with transplanted organs in the emergency department  (ED)  involves  three  general  areas:  (1)  disorders  specific  to  certain transplanted  organs,  (2)  disorders  common  to  many  different  kinds  of transplant  patients  due  to  an  immunosuppressed  state  or  antirejection medications,  and  (3)  disorders  not  specifically  related  to  a  transplanted organ but where special care may be warranted due to associated medications or altered physiology. Disorders specific to the transplanted organ are manifestations  of  acute  rejection,  surgical  complications  specific  to  the procedure  performed,  and  altered  physiology  (most  important  in  cardiac transplantation).  The  most  common  conditions  that  prompt  transplant patients to present to the ED are infections (39%), noninfectious gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary pathology (15%), dehydration (15%), electrolyte disturbances (10%), cardiopulmonary pathology (10%) or injury (8%), and rejection (6%).

# ■ POSTTRANSPLANT INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS

Posttransplant infections are the most common presenting diagnosis to the ED for this patient population, in part due to the ongoing immunosuppression  required  for  transplant  recipients.  Additional  infection  risk  factors include  diabetes  mellitus,  advanced  age,  obesity,  and  other  host  factors. Table 99-1 lists the broad array of potential infections and the time after transplant they are most likely to occur.

548 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

# Clinical Features

The most common reason for transplant recipients to present to the ED is fever, although as many as half of transplant patients with serious infections can present without fever. When fever is present, the underlying cause in addition to a possible infection can be drug side effects, hypersensitivity reactions, rejection, or malignancy.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Pneumonia and urinary  tract  infections  are  the  most  common  infections found in this population. Blood counts, inflammatory markers, and tests of renal and liver function may be helpful to obtain in this group of complex patients. Maintain a low threshold for obtaining chest radiographs. Obtain appropriate  cultures  of  urine,  blood,  and  other  bodily  fluids  based  on patient symptoms, presentation, physical examination findings, and disease severity. Consider the possibility of central nervous system infections such as meningitis or encephalitis and perform lumbar puncture when appropriate.  Liver transplant patients are especially susceptible to intraabdominal infections during the first postoperative month. Lung transplant patients are prone to pneumonia. Cardiac transplant patients may develop mediastinitis during the first postoperative month.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS

Therapeutic  immunosuppression  is  associated  with  a  number  of  adverse effects  and  complications. These  adverse  effects  are  typically  gradual  in onset and may include pancreatitis, bleeding, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, bradycardia or tachycardia, hyperkalemia, hypertension or hypotension,  cardiotoxicity,  pulmonary  edema,  seizures,  thromboembolic  events, and thrombocytopenia. Medication side effects such as fever or rigors may be  similar  to  symptoms  that  would  otherwise  suggest  an  infection.  A headache syndrome often indistinguishable from migraine is common in transplant recipients and usually develops within the first two months of immunosuppression,  and  may  require  an  initial  workup  to  exclude  lifethreatening conditions such as a mass lesion or infection. As the number of immunosuppressive drugs has increased dramatically, a complete listing of adverse effects is beyond the scope of this manual. Please refer to the parent textbook, referenced at the end of this chapter, or to web resources for a more complete listing of side effects of these medications.

An illness that prevents a transplant patient from successfully taking his or her immunosuppressive therapy may warrant hospital admission for IV therapy.  Consider  discussing  new  medications  with  a  member  of  the patient's transplant team, as starting even simple medications can precipitate complications.

# ■ CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

Heart  transplantation  results  in  a  denervated  heart  that  does  not  respond with centrally mediated tachycardia in response to stress or exercise, but does  respond  appropriately  to  circulating  catecholamines.  Patients  therefore may experience fatigue or shortness of breath at the onset of exercise

--- Page 570 ---

550 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

before an appropriate increase in heart rate occurs over time to meet the metabolic demand. A donor heart is implanted with its sinus node intact to preserve normal atrioventricular conduction, and therefore a normal heart rate  is  typically  90  to  100  beats/min.  However,  electrocardiograms  frequently will have two distinct P waves as the technique of cardiac transplantation also preserves the recipient's native sinus node at the superior cavoatrial junction. The sinus node of the donor heart is easily identified by its  constant 1:1 relation to the QRS complex, whereas the native P wave appears independently through the donor heart rhythm.

# Clinical Features

Because the heart is denervated, patients experiencing myocardial ischemia do not present with angina. Instead, heart transplant recipients may present with  heart  failure  secondary  to  silent  myocardial  infarctions.  Evaluate transplant  recipients  who  have  new-onset  shortness  of  breath,  chest  fullness,  or  symptoms of congestive heart failure with an electrocardiogram and serial troponin levels to evaluate for the possible presence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.

Although most episodes of acute cardiac transplant rejection are asymptomatic, the most common symptoms that do occur are dysrhythmias and generalized  fatigue.  Consider  the  possibility  of  transplant  rejection  for patients who present with atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia or symptoms of acute heart failure. In children, rejection may present with low-grade fever, fussiness, and poor feeding.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

# Clinical Features

A  lung  transplant  patient  suffering  rejection  may  develop  cough,  chest tightness, fever, and hypoxemia. Infection, such as interstitial pneumonia, may present with a clinical picture similar to acute rejection. Acute rejection can manifest very quickly, with a severe and rapid decline in patient status and in some circumstances an isolated fever may be the only initial finding. Spirometry may show a > 10% drop in forced expiratory volume in  1  second, and physical examination may reveal rales and adventitious sounds. Chest radiograph may demonstrate bilateral interstitial infiltrates or

--- Page 571 ---

CHAPTER 99: The Transplant Patient 551

effusions but may be normal in some patients, particularly when rejection occurs longer than 6 weeks after transplant. The further removed a patient is from transplant, the less classic a chest radiograph may appear for acute rejection. Bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy is usually needed to confirm rejection and exclude infection.

# Diagnosis and Differential

To assess a lung transplant patient for findings of infection or acute rejection,  clinicians  may  obtain  a  chest  radiograph,  pulse  oximetry,  arterial blood gas analysis, spirometry, complete blood cell count, serum electrolytes, creatinine and magnesium levels, and appropriate drug levels.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ RENAL TRANSPLANT

# Clinical Features

Renal transplant recipients with symptoms of acute rejection complain of vague tenderness over the allograft, which is typically located in the left or right iliac fossa. Patients also may describe decreased urine output, rapid weight gain from fluid retention, low-grade fever, and generalized malaise. Physical examination may reveal worsening hypertension, allograft tenderness,  and  peripheral  edema.  The  absence  of  these  symptoms  and  signs, however, may not entirely exclude the possibility of acute rejection, as an asymptomatic decline in renal function may be the only initial finding to suggest acute rejection.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Even small changes in creatinine values may be important in assessing a renal  transplant  patient's  risk  of  acute  rejection.  When  rejection  is  suspected,  obtain  a  urinalysis,  renal  ultrasonography,  levels  of  immunosuppressive drugs, and a thorough history and examination. Interpret changes in renal function in the context of prior data such as trends of recent serum creatinine  levels,  recent  history  of  rejection,  or  other  causes  of  allograft dysfunction. In addition to considering acute rejection, evaluate for other potential causes of decreased renal function such as dehydration or cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity.

Imaging  may  be  helpful  to  evaluate  the  graft.  Renal  ultrasound  can detect urinary obstruction. MRI can be used to detect hematomas and fluid collections, vascular abnormalities, and infarctions caused by medicationinduced  vasculitis.  Discuss  imaging  options  with  the  transplant  team, particularly  before  using  gadolinium-based  contrast  agents  in  a  renal transplant patient.

552 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ LIVER TRANSPLANT

# Clinical Features

Although frequently subtle in presentation, a syndrome of acute liver transplant rejection  includes  fever,  liver  tenderness,  lymphocytosis,  eosinophilia,  liver enzyme elevation, and a change in bile color or production. In the perioperative period, the differential diagnosis also includes infection, acute biliary obstruction, or vascular insufficiency. Diagnosis can be made with certainty only by hepatic  ultrasound  and  biopsy,  which  usually  requires  referral  back  to  the transplant center for diagnosis and management of this complication.

Possible  postsurgical  complications  in  liver  transplant  patients  include biliary  obstruction,  biliary  leakage,  and  hepatic  artery  thrombosis.  Biliary obstruction  follows  three  typical  presentations:  (1)  intermittent  episodes  of fever and fluctuating liver function tests, (2) a gradual worsening of liver function  tests  without  symptoms, and (3) acute bacterial cholangitis with fever, chills, abdominal pain, jaundice, and bacteremia. These complications can be difficult  to  distinguish  clinically  from  rejection,  hepatic  artery  thrombosis, CMV infection, or a recurrence of a preexisting disease such as hepatitis.

If a postsurgical biliary complication is suspected, obtain a chest radiograph, complete blood count, serum chemistry levels, liver function tests, basic  coagulation  studies,  and  lipase  levels.  Consider  cultures  of  blood, urine, bile, or ascites, as appropriate. An abdominal ultrasound can evaluate for  fluid  collections,  thrombosis  of  the  hepatic  artery  or  portal  vein,  and dilatation of the biliary tree. Alternatively, abdominal computed tomography  can  be  used.  Some  patients  may  benefit  from  cholangiography  or ERCP if biliary obstruction is suspected.

Biliary leakage is associated with 50% mortality and occurs most frequently in the third or fourth postoperative week. This high rate of mortality may  be  related  to  concomitant  hepatic  artery  thrombosis,  infection  of leaked bile, or difficult repair when the tissue is inflamed. Patients most often have peritoneal signs and fever, but these signs may be masked by use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents. Laboratory studies may reveal elevated  prothrombin  time  and  transaminase  levels  with  little  or  no  bile production. This complication also may present as acute graft failure, liver abscess, unexplained sepsis, or biliary tract leakage, obstruction, abscess, or breakdown of the anastomosis.

# ■ hEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT

Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is performed for a variety of conditions,  including  hematopoietic  malignancies,  severe  anemia,  and other conditions. The most common complication of HSCT is graft-versushost disease, affecting approximately 50% of HSCT patients.

# Clinical Features

A HSCT recipient presenting to the ED with nonspecific maculopapular rash (see Fig. 99-1) should be evaluated for possible graft-versus-host disease. The rash may be pruritic or painful, and frequently demonstrates a

--- Page 574 ---

554 SECTION 10: Infectious and Immunologic Diseases

brownish hue with slight scaling. The distribution varies greatly but often involves palms and soles initially, and later progresses to cheek, ears, neck, trunk, chest, and upper back. In the more severe forms, skin involvement is erythrodermic or may show bullae formation. Mucositis has been reported to occur in 35% to 70% of patients.

The second most common presentation of graft-versus-host disease is diarrhea.  Upper  GI  symptoms  such  as  anorexia,  nausea,  and  emesis  are common. The patient may develop painful cramping, ileus, and, sometimes, life-threatening hemorrhage from the colon.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  initial  diagnosis  of  graft-versus-host  disease  is  made  on  clinical grounds. A patient with a significant GI hemorrhage in the early posttransplant period may have coagulation deficits, especially thrombocytopenia. The  differential  diagnosis  of  GI  bleeding  in  this  setting  includes  all  the usual  causes  in  addition  to  infection.  Hepatic  involvement  presents  with hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver function tests.

# Toxicology and Pharmacology

# General Management of the Poisoned Patient

L. Keith French

Death from unintentional poisoning is a growing problem worldwide and prevention requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Knowledge of appropriate  decontamination  techniques  and  timely  administration  of  antidotes coupled with excellent supportive care may positively alter the outcome of poisoned patients.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

A detailed history is essential in the evaluation of a potentially poisoned patient.  In  the  conscious,  cooperative  person,  the  specific  agent(s),  time, route, amount, and intent of exposure need to be determined. In the uncooperative  or  altered  patient,  adjunctive  information  from  friends,  family, prehospital  providers,  police,  or  bystanders  may  provide  more  accurate details. Environmental clues such as drug paraphernalia, empty pill bottles, odors, or suicide notes may aid in the diagnosis. If available, review hospital  records  for  recent  prescriptions  or  any  history  of  psychiatric  illness. Loose pills with imprint codes may be identified by the pharmacy or Poison Center.

A thorough exam begins with a completely disrobed patient. Review all vital signs and perform a comprehensive physical examination. Focus on the general appearance, level of consciousness, pupil size, mucous membranes,  respiratory  rate,  breath  sounds,  presence  of  bowel  sounds,  skin temperature, and muscle tone as the combination of findings may suggest a specific toxidrome (Table 100-1). Important clinical features in the poisoned patient include hypoglycemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, seizures, agitation, and temperature alterations.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

A  diagnosis  of  poisoning  is  established  primarily  through  the  history, though the physical examination may provide clues when a history is not possible. Specific toxicology screens may be available, but are, in general, of limited utility and seldom impact care or outcome (Table 100-2). Falsenegative or false-positive results for drugs of abuse may be confusing and

--- Page 586 ---

# ■ CYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS

Cyclic  antidepressants  inhibit  reuptake  of  norepinephrine  and  serotonin, block sodium channels, and antagonize postsynaptic serotonin receptors. They can produce severe toxicity in overdose. Their use has declined as newer, safer agents have been developed.

# Clinical Features

Toxicity may present with altered mental status, seizures, cardiac conduction  or  rhythm  disturbances,  hypotension,  respiratory  depression,  and,  in severe  cases,  coma.  If  serious  toxicity  is  going  to  develop,  it  generally develops within 6 hours of the ingestion.

# Diagnosis

The diagnosis is clinical. Characteristic ECG changes include sinus tachycardia; right axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms; PR, QRS, and QT interval prolongation.  Right  bundle-branch  block,  A-V  blocks,  and  the  Brugada pattern  are  less  common. Amoxapine can notably cause toxicity without characteristic ECG changes.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Care is primarily supportive.

# ■ ATYPICAL ANTIDEPRESSANTS, SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INhIBITORS, AND SEROTONIN SYNDROME

Newer antidepressants include trazodone, bupropion, mirtazapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. They are safer than older agents but can still cause toxicity, including the serotonin syndrome.

# ■ TRAZODONE

# Clinical Features

Symptoms of toxicity include central nervous system depression, ataxia, dizziness, seizures, orthostatic hypotension, vomiting, and abdominal pain. ECG  abnormalities  include  QT  interval  prolongation,  sinus  bradycardia and tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. Priapism can be seen at therapeutic doses.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Supportive care is generally sufficient in isolated overdoses.

# ■ BUPROPION

# Clinical Features

Toxicity  manifests  as  agitation,  dizziness,  tremor,  vomiting,  drowsiness, and tachycardia. Seizures are more common than with other atypical antidepressants and can be the initial presenting sign. ECG changes include sinus tachycardia, QRS interval widening, and QT interval prolongation.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Seizures should be anticipated.

# ■ MIRTAZAPINE

# Clinical Features

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ SELECTIVE-SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INhIBITORS

# Clinical Features

Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,  paroxetine,  sertraline,  citalopram,  and  escitalopram.  Signs  and symptoms  may  include  vomiting,  sedation,  tremor,  sinus  tachycardia, mydriasis, seizures, diarrhea, and hallucinations. Sinus bradycardia is more common with fluvoxamine than with other SSRIs. QRS and QT interval prolongation has been reported in citalopram and escitalopram ingestions.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Supportive care is generally sufficient.

# ■ SEROTONIN-NOREPINEPhRINE REUPTAKE INhIBITORS

# Clinical Features

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) include venlafaxine, duloxetine,  levomilnacipran,  and  desvenlafaxine.  Overdose  may  cause hypotension, diaphoresis, tremor, mydriasis, sedation, coma, and seizures. ECG changes include sinus tachycardia and QRS or QT interval widening. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with venlafaxine overdoses with and without seizures.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

There are no established guidelines for treating SNRI overdoses.

# ■ SEROTONIN SYNDROME

Serotonin  syndrome  is  a  potentially  life-threatening  adverse  reaction  to serotoninergic medications. It can be produced by any drug or combination of drugs that increase central serotonin neurotransmission, most commonly antidepressants.

# Clinical Features

Signs and symptoms are altered mental status, hyperthermia, seizures, and increased muscle tone, particularly myoclonus. Hyperthermia is the most common cause of death.

# Diagnosis

Symptoms are nonspecific, and there are no confirmatory laboratory tests. Diagnostic criteria emphasize exposure to a serotoninergic drug and presence of myoclonus.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is supportive. Watch patients for rhabdomyolysis and metabolic acidosis.

# ■ MONOAMINE OXIDASE INhIBITORS

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are used to treat refractory depression. They cause accumulation of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in  presynaptic  nerve  terminals  and  increased  systemic  availability  of dietary amines, such as tyramine. MAOIs can lead to fatal food and drug interactions and cause severe toxicity in overdose.

# Clinical Features

Symptoms include headache, agitation, palpitations, chest pain, and tremor. Signs include sinus tachycardia, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, fasciculations, mydriasis,  hyperventilation,  nystagmus,  flushing,  muscle  rigidity,  and

--- Page 590 ---

hypertension. Signs and symptoms often are delayed after ingestion and the delay  can  be  up  to  24  hours.  Coma,  seizures,  bradycardia,  hypotension, hypoxia, and hyperthermia may develop. Death usually results from multiorgan failure.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. Laboratory tests can identify complications,  including  rhabdomyolysis,  renal  failure,  hyperkalemia,  metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The differential diagnosis  includes  drugs  and  conditions  that  produce  a  hyperadrenergic state, altered mental status, and/or muscle rigidity.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment consists of supportive care and management of complications.

# ■ ANTIPSYChOTICS

Antipsychotics  are  used  to  treat  psychosis,  agitation,  nausea,  headaches, hiccups, and involuntary motor disorders. Their therapeutic action involves blockade of dopamine receptors.

# Clinical Features

Central nervous system effects include lethargy, ataxia, dysarthria, confusion, and coma. Seizures are more common with loxapine and clozapine. Antimuscarinic toxicity may be seen. Cardiovascular manifestations include orthostatic hypotension; sinus tachycardia; PR, QRS, and QT interval prolongation; and  ST  and  T  wave  abnormalities.  Extrapyramidal  symptoms  such  as dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia can be seen during therapeutic use.

--- Page 591 ---

CHAPTER 102: Psychopharmacologic Agents

571

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic agents. It typically develops over 1 to 3 days. It is characterized by fever, muscular rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and altered mental status (Table 102-1). Death results from complications of muscle rigidity, such as rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, or cardiac or respiratory failure.

# Diagnosis

Diagnostic studies should include a complete blood count, basic chemistries, a pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, and an ECG. Also obtain a creatine kinase level and liver function tests in patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is largely supportive.

572 SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

# ■ LIThIUM

Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder and mania. Toxicity results from overdose or altered renal clearance. Death is usually from respiratory or cardiac failure.

# Clinical Features

Patients may present with tremor, muscle fasciculations or weakness, clonus, ataxia, agitation, peripheral neuropathy, lethargy, or coma. Acute renal failure may be noted, especially in the elderly and those with preexisting renal impairment, diabetes, hypertension, or dehydration. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in acute and chronic toxicity. Cardiac abnormalities are  more  common in acute toxicity and include conduction disturbances and ventricular dysrhythmias. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism can be noted as adverse effects from chronic therapeutic use.

# Diagnosis

Acute  overdoses  present  with  more  GI  than  neurologic  toxicity.  Serum lithium levels may not correlate well with symptoms. Patients with chronic toxicity  display  more  neurologic  effects  at  lower  levels.  In  this  setting, serum lithium levels correlate better with toxicity. Acute-on-chronic ingestions have aspects of both. ECG abnormalities include QT interval prolongation and T wave inversions.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Stabilization  includes  securing  the  airway  and  ventilatory  and  hemodynamic support.

# Sedatives and Hypnotics

Shan Yin

Sedative and hypnotic medications are commonly used pharmaceuticals. The three classes include barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and nonbenzodiazepines (buspirone, carisoprodol, meprobamate, chloral hydrate, γ -hydroxybutyrate, melatonin, ramelteon, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone).

# ■ BARBITURATES

# Clinical Features

Among the sedative-hypnotic class of medications, barbiturates are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Owing to safer alternatives for seizure management, the clinical use of barbiturates has declined.

Barbiturates cause a dose-dependent spectrum of central nervous system depression. With mild to moderate ingestions, toxicity resembles that of  ethanol  or  other  sedative-hypnotic  medications:  confusion,  ataxia, slurred speech, drowsiness, and disinhibition. Gastrointestinal motility may be slowed. The toxic dose will vary depending on route, speed of administration,  and patient tolerance. Severe intoxication follows a tenfold overdose, and loss of deep tendon and corneal reflexes may occur. Hypothermia, hypotension, and respiratory depression are common. Complicating features of the toxicity include hypoglycemia, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and acute lung injury.

Barbiturate  withdrawal  syndrome  may  occur  in  the  habituated  patient who suddenly stops taking  their  medication. The  syndrome  occurs  within 24 hours of cessation and begins with mild symptoms, which may become severe over the next 2 to 8 days. Short-acting barbiturates generally cause a more  robust  withdrawal  syndrome  than  the  long-acting  products.  Minor symptoms  include  anxiety,  restlessness,  depression,  insomnia,  anorexia, nausea,  and  vomiting.  Major  symptoms  include  psychosis,  hallucinations, delirium, generalized seizures, hyperthermia, and cardiovascular collapse. Barbiturate withdrawal has a high mortality and gradual inpatient withdrawal of the addicting agent is recommended.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Serum barbiturate levels may help establish an etiology for altered mental status in a comatose patient; however, decisions regarding management are based primarily on clinical grounds. Mixed sedative-hypnotic ingestions may be inappropriately ascribed to the barbiturate alone. Due to variability among patients with barbiturate overdoses, heart rate, pupil size and reactivity, and nystagmus are not clinically distinguishing signs. Skin bullae ('barbiturate blisters') are rarely evident and are not specific to barbiturates. Myocardial depression is more common with barbiturates than benzodiazepines.

Bedside glucose measurement is imperative in the patient with altered mental status and may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Other useful diagnostic testing includes arterial or venous blood gas analysis, electrocardiogram, liver function tests, salicylate and acetaminophen concentrations,

blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, complete blood count, and creatinine phosphate kinase.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment begins with airway management and supportive care. Once pulmonary  and  cardiovascular  function  have  been  adequately  assessed  and stabilized, enhancing elimination can be considered.

# ■ BENZODIAZEpINES

# Clinical Features

Benzodiazepine overdoses are common but carry a low mortality rate in isolation. There is, however, variation in the clinical outcome among agents due  to  differences  in  potency.  Parenteral  administration  in  the  ED  may produce  significant  complications.  Benzodiazepines,  when  mixed  with other sedative-hypnotics, may produce profound toxicity including respiratory depression, hypotension, and death.

The primary effect of benzodiazepines is central nervous system depression and is characterized by somnolence, dizziness, slurred speech, confusion, ataxia, incoordination, and general impairment in intellectual function. Neurologic  effects  in  the  elderly,  very  young,  or  malnourished  may  be prolonged  or  enhanced.  Disinhibition,  extrapyramidal  reactions,  and

--- Page 596 ---

576

SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

paradoxical excitation are uncommon but reported. Short-term, anterograde amnesia is a common, sometimes desirable, effect with the administration of certain benzodiazepines.

Chronic use of benzodiazepines is associated with physiologic addiction. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines may occur following abrupt cessation. Symptoms are more intense following withdrawal from short-acting agents.  Clinical  findings  may  mimic  alcohol  withdrawal  and  include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, and sweating. Serious  manifestations  include  hallucinations,  psychosis,  disorientation,  and seizures.  Treatment  begins  with  reintroduction  of  a  benzodiazepine  with subsequent, gradual tapering.

# Diagnosis and Differential

There is limited value in toxicological testing as serum levels do not correlate well  with  clinical  findings.  Qualitative  urine  screening  is  unreliable  and  a positive test does not prove causation of clinical signs as clinical features are nonspecific and may be seen with overdose of any sedative-hypnotic.

# Clinical Features

The hallmark of all sedative-hypnotic medications, regardless of subclass, is sedation. Exposure to nonbenzodiazepine agents is common and coingestion with other sedatives may be synergistic and produce profound sedation.  Three  agents,  ethchlorvynol,  glutethimide,  and  methaqualone,  have been removed from the markets in the United States and Canada.

# Buspirone

Buspirone has a complex mechanism of action and rapid absorption. Side effects include sedation, GI distress, vomiting, and dizziness. The symptoms with overdose are exaggerations of the side effects noted with therapeutic  dosing.  The  drug  is  generally  well  tolerated  in  overdose,  and treatment is primarily supportive. Due to effects on the serotoninergic system,  serotonin  syndrome  has  been  reported.  Seizures,  hypotension,  priapism, and dystonia are rare complications.

# Carisoprodol and Meprobamate

Carisoprodol  and  its  active  metabolite,  meprobamate,  are  marketed  as central-acting muscle relaxants and anxiolytics, respectively. In overdoses, both may cause sedation, coma, and cardiopulmonary depression. Carisoprodol, but not meprobamate, can cause myoclonus, which may be a clue in  an  unknown  overdose.  Meprobamate  has  been  associated  with  pharmacobezoars, and may be a cause of prolonged toxicity.

# Chloral Hydrate

Chloral hydrate is the oldest sedative-hypnotic available today. At therapeutic doses, chloral hydrate produces mental status depression without loss of airway and respiratory reflexes. Vomiting and paradoxical excitation can occur in a small percentage of children. In overdose, coma and respiratory depression can occur. Chloral hydrate is a myocardial sensitizer and cardiac dysrhythmias,  decreased  cardiac  contractility,  and  asystole  have  been reported. When combined with alcohol, a potent, 'knock-down' cocktail known as a 'Mickey Finn' is created. A withdrawal syndrome similar to ethanol has been described.

Chloral hydrate may produce a characteristic pear-like odor. Abdominal radiographs  may  aid  in  the  diagnosis  of  pharmacobezoars,  as  chloral hydrate is  radiopaque.  Respiratory  depression  and  coma  are  treated  supportively. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with IV β -blockers .

# γ -Hydroxybutyrate

γ -Hydroxybutyrate  (GHB)  has  been  marketed  as  a  muscle  builder,  fat burner,  antidepressant,  anxiolytic,  hypnotic,  and  cholesterol-lowering medication. The only approved use in the United States is for the treatment of narcolepsy and is prescribed as its sodium salt (sodium oxybate). GHB is  often  used  illicitly  and  has  street  names  including  'liquid  ecstasy,' 'Georgia home boy,' 'G,' and 'grievous bodily harm.' GHB has a narrow therapeutic window and may produce a range of toxicity from mild sedation to coma. Seizures, bradycardia, hypothermia, and cardiac depression

--- Page 598 ---

578 SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

may occur. Rapid sedation with abrupt recovery 6 to 12 hours later is a common feature with GHB. Due to its amnestic effects and rapid sedation, GHB has been illicitly used for drug-facilitated sexual assault. Two compounds, 1,4 butanediol and γ -butyrolactone are GHB precursors and have been abused to produce similar effects. Treatment is primarily supportive with focus on airway management. Physostigmine and neostigmine should be  avoided.  Rapid  awaking  and  self-extubation  may  be  a  clue  to  GHB intoxication. Toxicologic detection of GHB is difficulty owing to its very short half-life and rapid elimination. Withdrawal from GHB mimics alcohol withdrawal and may be severe, lasting from 3 days to 2 weeks.

# Melatonin

The endogenous hormone melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland and is believed to help regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin can be purchased without  prescription.  Side  effects  following  therapeutic  dosing  include headache, dizziness, fatigue, and irritability. Overdose data are limited, and signs and symptoms exaggerate the side effects from therapeutic doses.

# Ramelteon

Ramelteon is a relatively new medication used to treat insomnia. It binds to melatonin receptors in the brain. Absorption following oral dosing is rapid. In overdose, sedation is common and treatment is supportive. Abuse and withdrawal have not been reported.

# Tasimelteon

Tasimelteon  is  used  to  treat  non-24-hour  sleep-wake  disorder.  It  peaks quickly following ingestion. There is no data on overdoses currently. Abuse and withdrawal have not been reported.

# Zolpidem, Zaleplon, and Zopiclone

Zolpidem, zaleplon, and zopiclone have gained increased popularity for the treatment of insomnia. Though initially thought to produce little or no psychomotor  impairment,  addiction  or  withdrawal,  experience  has  proved otherwise.  Zaleplon  appears  to  be  less  likely  to  cause  withdrawal  than zolpidem or zopiclone. Side effects in therapeutic doses include nausea and somnolence. Sedation would be the expected primary effect after overdose. Vivid dreams, sleep-walking, and driving have been reported with zolpidem. Fatalities following zolpidem overdoses have been reported, but are usually associated with mixed ingestions. Methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia have been reported after large zoplicone overdoses.

--- Page 600 ---

All alcohols are potentially toxic and cause clinical inebriation. Ethanol and isopropanol  are  the  most  commonly  ingested  alcohols  and  cause  direct toxicity, while methanol and ethylene glycol cause toxicity as a result of conversion to toxic metabolites.

# ■ ETHANOL

Ethanol is the most commonly abused drug in the world. While acute toxicity may result in death due to respiratory depression, the majority of morbidity and mortality is due to trauma owing to impaired cognitive function. Blood ethanol levels correlate poorly with the degree of intoxication due to the development of tolerance. On an average, nondrinkers metabolize ethanol at a rate of 20 mg/dL/h, whereas chronic alcoholics metabolize ethanol at a rate of 30 mg/dL/h.

# Clinical Features

Signs and symptoms of ethanol intoxication include disinhibited behavior, slurred  speech,  impaired  coordination,  followed  later  by  respiratory  and central nervous system (CNS) depression.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Head injury and hypoglycemia can present similarly to ethanol intoxication, and these diagnoses may coexist. Glucose should be measured in all patients with altered mental status. In those patients without a clear explanation for their altered mental status, serum ethanol levels may help confirm  intoxication,  although  the  value  may  be  difficult  to  interpret.  For patients with comorbid disease or injury, additional labs that may be helpful include the following: electrolytes may demonstrate an anion gap acidosis; liver enzymes may reveal hepatic damage. Obtain imaging as indicated by external signs of trauma in the inebriated patient.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ISOPROPANOL

Isopropanol is commonly found in rubbing alcohol, solvents, skin and hair products,  paint  thinners,  and  antifreeze.  Acetone  is  the  principal  toxic metabolite.

--- Page 601 ---

CHAPTER 104: Alcohols

581

# Clinical Features

Clinically,  isopropanol  intoxication  is  similar  to  that  of  ethanol  but  produces a greater degree of intoxication than ethanol. Severe poisoning presents  as  coma,  respiratory  depression,  and  hypotension.  Hemorrhagic gastritis  is  common  and  causes  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A glucose level should be measured in all patients with altered mental status. Laboratory studies may reveal an elevated osmolal gap, ketonemia, and ketonuria, without acidosis. In the setting of upper GI bleeding, coagulation studies, a complete blood count, and a type and screen should be obtained. When available, serum isopropanol and acetone levels confirm the diagnosis, but are not required for management.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ METHANOL AND ETHYLENE GLYCOL

Methanol is commonly found in windshield washing fluid, solid fuel for stoves,  and  solvents.  Ethylene  glycol  is  commonly  found  in  antifreeze. Toxicity from these alcohols results from the formation of toxic metabolites, which produce a significant anion gap metabolic acidosis. Methanol leads to the formation of toxic formic acid, while ethylene glycol is metabolized into the toxic compounds glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxylic acid with subsequent formation of calcium oxylate crystals.

# Clinical Features

The clinical features of methanol toxicity include metabolic acidosis, CNS depression,  and  visual  changes  (classically,  a  complaint  of  looking  at  a snowstorm). The onset of symptoms may be delayed with concurrent ethanol  consumption.  Funduscopic  examination  may  reveal  retinal  edema  or hyperemia of the optic disk.

Ethylene glycol poisoning often exhibits three distinct clinical phases after ingestion. First, within 12 hours, CNS effects predominate: the patient appears  intoxicated  without  the  odor  of  ethanol  on  the  breath.  Second,

--- Page 602 ---

582 SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

12  to  24  hours  after  ingestion,  cardiopulmonary  effects  predominate: elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are common. Congestive heart failure, respiratory distress syndrome, and circulatory collapse may develop. Third, 24 to 72 hours after ingestion, renal effects predominate which are characterized by flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and  acute  tubular  necrosis  with  acute  renal  failure.  Hypocalcemia  may result from precipitation of calcium oxalate into tissues leading to tetany and typical ECG changes.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings of an elevated osmol gap, and/or an anion gap metabolic acidosis (which may take hours to develop). Elevated levels of methanol or ethylene glycol can confirm toxicity. An elevated osmolal gap is present early, and may be useful when methanol or ethylene glycol testing is not immediately available. Basic  laboratory  investigations  include  a  bedside  glucose,  electrolytes, renal  function  arterial  blood  gas,  urinalysis,  and  methanol  or  ethylene glycol level. Ethylene glycol poisoning differs from methanol poisoning in that  visual  disturbances  and  fundoscopic  abnormalities  are  absent  and calcium oxalate crystals may be present in the urine.

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of an anion gap metabolic acidosis such as salicylate or isoniazid toxicity, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, uremia, and lactic acidosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is based on metabolic blockade and removing toxic metabolites from  the  body.  Both  fomepizole  and  ethanol  have  a  greater  affinity  for alcohol dehydrogenase than methanol and ethylene glycol. Indications for metabolic blockade are listed in Table 104-1.

# TAblE 104-1 Indications for Metabolic Blockade with Fomepizole or Ethanol

Unexplained metabolic acidosis and ethanol level of < 100 mg/dL ( < 22 mmol/L) *

* If serum ethanol level is > 100 mg/dL ( > 22 mmol/L), patient will be protected from the formation of toxic metabolites by coingestion of ethanol, and specific metabolic blockade treatment can be delayed until toxic alcohol level is available. If the ethanol level is likely to fall to < 100 mg/dL before the toxic alcohol results are back, then initiate metabolic blockade.

# ■ OPIOIDS

The term opioid refers to any drug that is active at the opioid receptor, while opiates refers to naturally occurring derivatives of the opium plant, such as morphine. Narcotic is a legal term and generically refers to any drug that causes sedation. Emergency physicians commonly utilize opioids as analgesics and must be familiar with the clinical presentation and treatment of opioid toxicity.

# Clinical Features

Opioid overdose produces a clinical toxidrome: miosis, and central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression. However, normal or large pupils may be seen with diphenoxylate, meperidine, pentazocine, and propoxyphene  toxicities.  Severe  hypoxia  or  co-ingestants  could  also  produce mydriasis. Severe opioid overdose, especially with heroin, may be associated  with  acute  lung  injury.  Seizures  have  been  reported  with  tramadol, propoxyphene,  and  meperidine  overdoses.  Meperidine,  tramadol,  and dextromethorphan  have  been  associated  with  serotonin  syndrome  when combined with other serotonergic agents. Methadone may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. Opioid withdrawal is manifest by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysphoria, piloerection, and lacrimation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is clinical. Qualitative immunoassay urine drug screens are commonly  available  but  must  be  interpreted  with  caution  as  there  are numerous agents that produce false-positive and false-negative results for opioids.  Toxicity  from  clonidine,  guanfacine,  and  imidazolines  mimics opioid  intoxication  and  produces  varying  degrees  of  miosis  and  CNS/ respiratory depression. Because response to naloxone with these agents is less reliable, consider clonidine intoxication in patients who appear opioid poisoned but do not respond to naloxone. Other possible causes of CNS depression  and  miosis  include  pontine  hemorrhage  and  toxicity  from organophosphates/carbamates,  antipsychotics,  and  sedative-hypnotics (i.e., GHB).

CHAPTER 105: Drugs of Abuse

585

# ■ COCAINe AND AMPhetAMINeS

Cocaine and amphetamines are widely used drugs of abuse and produce similar clinical manifestations.

# Clinical Features

Cocaine  and  amphetamines  induce  euphoria  and  produce  complications secondary to the enhanced release and blockade of catecholamines at the synaptic receptors. Onset of effect via intranasal, inhalational (crack use), and intravenous use is rapid. Repeated drug administration leads to prolonged  effects  and  increased  toxicity.  Symptoms  of  sympathomimetic overdose include mydriasis, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, agitation, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and hyperthermia.

Cardiovascular  complications  include  dysrhythmias,  myocardial  ischemia, cardiomyopathy, and aortic/coronary artery dissection. Chest pain is common  and  often  atypical.  Patients  are  at  risk  of  developing  an  acute coronary  syndrome  (STEMI  and  NSTEMI)  related  to  vasospasm  and increased thrombogenesis. Cocaine dysrhythmias result from sodium and potassium blockade. Following cocaine use patients may develop supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial fibrillation/flutter along with wide complex  tachycardia/dysrhythmias  similar  to  tricyclic  antidepressants.  The Brugada  pattern  and  prolonged  QT  may  also  be  seen  with  cocaine. Although amphetamines may result in SVT, other dysrhythmias are less commonly seen.

Neurologic  complications  of  cocaine  and  amphetamines  include  seizures, spinal cord infarctions, cerebral vasculitis, and ischemic/hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents. Choreoathetoid movements and dystonic reactions may occur. A 'washout' syndrome following heavy use may result in CNS  depression  that  generally  resolves  within  24  hours.  Amphetamine users may develop severe psychosis.

Cocaine users can develop pulmonary complications including pneumomediastinum,  pneumothorax,  bronchospasm,  and  pulmonary  edema  and hemorrhage. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy increases risk for spontaneous abortion, abruptio placentae, fetal prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation. 'Body stuffers' (hasty ingestion of drugs to avoid police) and 'body packers' (ingestion of large amounts of tightly packed pure drug for

importation) may be asymptomatic or demonstrate signs of severe cocaine toxicity if a bag ruptures.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis  of  cocaine,  amphetamine,  or  stimulant  intoxication  is  usually clinical. Urine drug screening for cocaine is reliable and can detect exposure within 72 hours. Urine screens for amphetamines are less specific and have high false-negative and false-positive results.

Additional  laboratory  evaluation  for  intoxicated  patients  includes  a complete metabolic panel to assess acid/base status, kidney function, and a  creatine kinase (CK) to assess for rhabdomyolysis. The evaluation of altered mental status or seizure may include a head CT to exclude intracranial  hemorrhage.  Consider  ECG,  chest  radiograph,  and  cardiac enzymes in cocaine- or amphetamine-intoxicated patients presenting with chest pain.

The differential diagnosis includes drug intoxications (anticholinergic, PCP,  serotonin  syndrome),  sedative-hypnotic  withdrawal,  stroke,  CNS infections, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and thyrotoxicosis. Concomitant use  of  substances  such  as  alcohol  or  opioids  may  significantly  alter  the presentation.

for possible laparotomy. Endoscopy should be avoided due to risk of rupture.

# ■ hALLUCINOGeNS

# Clinical Features

Table  105-1  summarizes  the  classification,  features,  complications,  and specific treatments of commonly abused hallucinogens.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis  is  primarily  clinical.  Routine  drug  screens  will  not  detect LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. Urine tests for phencyclidine (PCP) are unreliable.  Some  amphetamine  screens  will  detect  methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA).  Urine  tests  for  marijuana  are  unreliable indicators  of  acute  use  because  patients  may  be  positive  for  days  to weeks after their last use. Check glucose, electrolytes, renal function, CK, and urinalysis to evaluate for hyponatremia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury.

Exclude  other  causes  of  altered  mental  status,  including  traumatic injuries,  hypoglycemia,  and  infection  in  patients  with  hyperthermia. The differential diagnosis of hallucinogen intoxication includes alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, hypoglycemia, anticholinergic poisoning, thyrotoxicosis, CNS infections, structural CNS lesions, and acute psychosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most hallucinogen intoxications are managed by monitoring, providing a calm environment, and the use of benzodiazepines for agitation and sympathomimetic  symptoms.  Antipsychotic  medications  should  be  used  with caution  as  these  may  lower  seizure  threshold. β -Blockers  should  not  be used as noted above.

Prosser and  Jeanmarie  Perrone;  and  Chapter  188,  'Hallucinogens'  by  Katherine  M. Prybys and Karen N. Hansen.

--- Page 611 ---

Over-the-counter analgesics, such as salicylates (ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP), can result in fatal overdose, but early identification of toxicity and initiation of appropriate treatment can significantly reduce mortality from these exposures. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) overdoses are rarely fatal and typically require only supportive care. The widespread availability  of  these  medications  in  over-the-counter  preparations,  and  in other products (e.g., ASA in oil of wintergreen, APAP in cough and cold preparations), can lead to both intentional and accidental toxicity.

# ■ ASPIRIN AND SALICYLATES

# Clinical Features

The  features  of  aspirin  (ASA)  toxicity  are  summarized  in  Table  106-1. Chronic or 'therapeutic' (repeated dose) poisonings are generally more serious and associated with higher mortality than acute overdoses, and are typically encountered in elderly patients with multiple medical problems. Chronic toxicity  develops  at  lower  drug  levels  compared  to  acute  overdoses.  The duration of symptoms is often prolonged and there may be a delay in diagnosis  because  the  clinical  picture  can  mimic  infection.  Chronic  salicylism should be considered in any patient with unexplained nonfocal neurologic and behavioral abnormalities, especially with coexisting acid-base disturbance, tachypnea, dyspnea, fever, or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

In  children,  acute  ASA  overdoses  generally  present  within  hours  of ingestion.  Children  younger  than  4  years  of  age  tend  to  develop  early metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.38), whereas children older than 4 years usually manifest a mixed acid-base disturbance as seen in adults.

# Diagnosis and Differential

ASA toxicity is a clinical diagnosis made in conjunction with the patient's acid-base status. Respiratory alkalosis with an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and hypokalemia are the classic features of this poisoning. ASA blood concentrations correlate poorly with toxicity, and relying on ASA levels as a sole measure of toxicity is the most common pitfall in the management of ASA poisonings.

Check bedside glucose levels in all patients with altered mental status. Additional  laboratory  studies  include  electrolytes,  blood  urea  nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin time (PT), ASA level, APAP level (to exclude coingestion), and blood gas. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may be seen with severe or chronic toxicity.

The differential diagnosis of ASA toxicity includes diabetic ketoacidosis,  sepsis,  meningitis,  acute  iron  poisoning,  caffeine  overdose, theophylline toxicity, and Reye's syndrome.

# ■ ACETAMINOPhEN (APAP)

# Clinical Features

Acute  APAP  toxicity  can  present  in  four  classic  stages  outlined  in Table 106-2. Massive APAP ingestions (4-hour APAP level > 800 micrograms/mL)  may  cause  early  coma  or  agitation  and  lactic  acidosis, as  opposed  to  delayed  symptom  onset  seen  in  the  majority  of  APAP overdoses.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Toxic  exposure  to APAP  is  likely  when  a  patient > 6  years  old  ingests either:  (a) > 10 g or 200 mg/kg in a single ingestion or over a 24-hour period, or (b) > 6 g or 150 mg/kg/d for two consecutive days. For children < 6  years  old,  either:  (a) > 200  mg/kg  in  a  single  ingestion  or  over  an 8-hour period, or (b) 150 mg/kg/day for two consecutive days would be considered toxic. Confirm toxicity with a serum APAP concentration and an exact time of ingestion. Plot the serum APAP level on the RumackMatthew nomogram (Fig. 106-1); this nomogram applies only to the setting of a single acute exposure during the window between 4 hours and 24  hours  postingestion.  Obtain  additional  laboratory  studies  including electrolytes,  glucose,  BUN,  creatinine,  transaminases,  CBC,  PT,  ASA, urine toxicology screen, and ECG as clinically indicated (e.g., potential coingestion in the suicidal patient).

# Diagnosis and Differential

The manifestations of NSAID toxicity are generally nonspecific. NSAID levels  are  not  readily  available  or  clinically  useful  in  assessing  toxicity. Laboratory  evaluation  should  include  electrolytes,  glucose,  renal  and hepatic function tests, and an APAP level. Consideration of evaluation for co-ingestions should be made. Bedside glucose determination is indicated for altered mental status or seizures.

# ■ XANTHINES

Theophylline, theobromine, and caffeine are methylxanthines.

Theophylline was once widely used for the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and continues to be used for apnea of prematurity. Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world, and is consumed primarily from beverages such as coffee, tea, and energy  drinks,  but  is  also  contained  in  medications  and  dietary  supplements. Caffeine is used medically in the management of apnea of prematurity, and as an analgesic adjunct.

# Clinical Features

Methylxanthine toxicity can cause life-threatening cardiac, neurologic, and metabolic abnormalities. Even therapeutic concentrations of theophylline can cause significant side effects in some individuals. Elderly patients with concomitant  medical  problems  are  more  susceptible  to  life-threatening toxicity during chronic therapeutic use than are younger patients with acute overdose.

Cardiac side effects usually include sinus tachycardia, and may include atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias. Ventricular dysrhythmias are more common with severe toxicity, chronic toxicity, in the elderly, and those with underlying cardiac dysfunction. Hypotension may also occur as a result of peripheral Beta 2 induced vasodilation.

Neurologic toxicity includes agitation, headache, irritability, sleeplessness,  tremors,  hallucinations,  and  seizures.  Methylxanthine-induced  seizures can be severe and refractory to standard treatment.

Metabolic side effects include hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic  acidosis.  Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with theophylline and caffeine overdose. Compartment syndrome resulting from an unclear etiology is also a rare, but well-described occurrence in theophylline toxicity. Gastrointestinal (GI) effects commonly include nausea and vomiting. Nausea  and  vomiting  are  often  severe,  and  poorly  responsive  to  less  potent antiemetics.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Therapeutic  serum  theophylline  levels  of  20 μ g/mL  can  produce  toxic effects. In acute poisoning, severity of symptoms typically correlates with serum concentration, but with chronic or acute on chronic toxicity symptom severity correlates more poorly with concentration.

In  cases  of  chronic  or  acute  on  chronic  toxicity,  life-threatening  side effects can occur with little warning and before lesser symptoms manifest. Smoking cessation, cirrhosis, and numerous medications, such as cimetidine and erythromycin, increase the half-life of theophylline and increase risk  of  chronic  toxicity.  Investigations  recommended  for  theophylline  or

caffeine toxicity includes serial measurement of the serum theophylline or caffeine concentration, serum electrolytes, and a 12-lead ECG. The differential diagnosis includes other sympathomimetic overdose (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine) as well as anticholinergic toxicity.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment  of  methylxanthine  poisoning  consists  of  stabilization,  gastric decontamination  and  elimination,  treatment  of  life-threatening  toxic effects, and, in severe cases, hemoperfusion or dialysis.

unresponsive or poorly responsive to potassium supplementation because the force driving potassium intracellularly continues despite potassium supplementation. In cases of potassium supplementation, hyperkalemia may occur as massive quantities of potassium move extracellularly as the effect of theophylline or caffeine abates. Therefore, potassium supplementation is not recommended unless the patient experiences a dysrhythmia  likely  to  be  the  result  of  hypokalemia  or  empirically  if  the serum potassium is < 2.5 mmol/L

# ■ NICOTINE

Nicotine is present in tobacco products and smoking cessation medications, and is  also  used  as  an  outdoor  pesticide.  Pediatric  exposures  to  nicotine gum or discarded cigarette butts placed in a beverage such as a soda can are relatively common. Nicotine is rapidly absorbed through the lungs, mucous membranes, intestinal tract, and skin. Once absorbed, it binds to nicotinic receptors throughout the body including the central nervous system, autonomic system, and neuromuscular junction.

# Clinical Features

Nicotine toxicity affects the GI, neurologic, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems.  Nausea,  vomiting,  bradycardia,  dysrhythmias,  hypoventilation, coma, and seizures can occur. In severe poisoning, nicotine can result in paralysis  and  respiratory  arrest.  Table  107-2  lists  the  clinical  effects  of nicotinic receptor stimulation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of acute nicotine toxicity is largely based on history and physical examination.  The  differential  diagnosis  for  nicotine  toxicity  is  primarily cholinergic  poisoning  by  other  substances,  such  as  organophosphate  and carbamate pesticides, as well as cholinergic medication overdose.

# ■ DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES

Digoxin is used to treat atrial fibrillation, especially with concurrent congestive heart failure. Other cardiac glycosides are found in plants such as foxglove, oleander, and lily of the valley.

# Clinical Features

Toxicity  can  occur  following  acute  ingestion  or  develop  during  chronic therapy (Table 108-1). Acute toxicity typically presents with abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting. Characteristic cardiac effects include bradydysrhythmias  and/or  supraventricular  tachycardia  with  atrioventricular  block. Severe toxicity can result in ventricular dysrhythmias. Chronic toxicity is more common in the elderly and often occurs as a result of renal failure or diuretic  therapy.  Neuropsychiatric  symptoms  are  more  common  with chronic toxicity, though cardiac effects are similar to those seen with acute toxicity.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Hyperkalemia  is  often  seen  in  acute  poisoning,  but  may  be  absent  in chronic toxicity. Serum digoxin levels are neither sensitive nor specific for toxicity. However, those patients with higher levels ( > 2 ng/mL) are more likely to experience toxicity. Almost any dysrhythmia, except for rapidly conducted  atrial  dysrhythmias,  may  be  seen  with  toxicity;  however,  the

other  options  are  sodium  bicarbonate,  potassium-binding  resin,  or hemodialysis.  Historically,  IV  calcium  use  has  been  discouraged because  of  reports  of  ventricular  dysrhythmias.  However,  recent evidence suggests that IV calcium use is likely safe.

# ■ β -BLOCKErS

β -Blockers are used in the management of hypertension, acute coronary syndromes,  dysrhythmias,  congestive  heart  failure,  thyrotoxicosis,  social phobias, migraines, and glaucoma. In overdose, their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects result in progressive bradycardia and hypotension.

# Clinical Features

Toxicity  usually  develops  within  6  hours  of  ingestion  of  an  immediaterelease  product. With  sustained-release  preparations  toxicity  is  generally seen within 8 hours of ingestion. The cardiovascular system is the primary organ  system  affected;  however,  other  noncardiac  manifestations  may occur  (Table  108-4).  Sotalol,  unlike  other β -blockers,  is  also  a  class  III antidysrhythmic, and thus may cause QT-interval prolongation and torsades de pointes. The onset of toxicity from sotalol may be delayed up to 12 hours postingestion.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  diagnosis  is  made  based  on  clinical  findings.  An  ECG  should  be obtained in all cases. Laboratory studies are directed at identifying underlying medical conditions or complications. Specific drug levels are not commonly available and correlate poorly with clinical effects. Table 108-5 lists other agents that result in bradycardia and hypotension.

The goal of therapy is to restore cardiac output by increasing heart rate and improving myocardial contractility (Fig. 108-1). Establish continuous cardiac monitoring and IV access. IV fluids may be administered for hypotension.

Figure 108-1. Management strategies in β -blocker toxicity. Cardiac function is evaluated using ECG and cardiac ultrasound and/or a pulmonary artery catheter. For  patients  with  a  wide  QRS  interval,  consider  sodium  bicarbonate  therapy.  For patients with impaired myocardial contractility, consider glucagon, norepinephrine, insulin  and  glucose,  and/or  calcium  therapy.  For  patients  with  preserved  cardiac contractility,  administer  IV  fluids.  For  patients  with  decreased  systemic  vascular resistance, consider norepinephrine. For patients with bradycardia, consider atropine, glucagon, and/or cardiac pacing. (See the text for details.) IVF, IV fluids; SVR, systemic vascular resistance.

SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

# ■ CALCIUM ChANNEL BLOCKErS

Calcium channel blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension, vasospasm, and rate control of supraventricular tachydysrhythmias. Three widely used classes of calcium channel blockers are the phenylalkylamines (verapamil), benzothiazepines (diltiazem), and dihydropyridines (nifedipine, etc.).

# Clinical Features

Toxicity  usually  develops  within  6  hours  of  ingestion  of  an  immediaterelease product. With sustained-release preparations toxicity can be delayed 12 to 24 hours. Toxicity primarily affects the cardiovascular system causing sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and hypotension. Verapamil and diltiazem have a proportionally greater effect on the myocardium than the dihydropyridines. Dihydropyridine overdose can result in reflex tachycardia. With severe toxicity, all classes of calcium channel blockers can cause bradycardia, depressed myocardial contractility, and vasodilatation. Hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur. Central nervous system effects are due to hypoperfusion and other etiologies should be sought if the blood pressure is normal.

--- Page 627 ---

CHAPTER 108: Cardiac Medications

607

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is based on clinical findings. Laboratory studies help identify complications.  Hyperglycemia is  common and helps distinguish calcium channel blocker from β -blocker toxicity, which is associated with hypoglycemia. The differential diagnosis for bradycardia and hypotension is listed in Table 108-5.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is supportive, with an emphasis on increasing cardiac output and systemic  vascular  resistance  (Fig.  108-2).  Establish  continuous  cardiac monitoring and IV access. Administer IV fluids for hypotension.

All  listed  modalities  have  been shown to be potentially beneficial and in severe cases can be started simultaneously. D10W, 10% dextrose in water. The use of lipid emulsion therapy should be reserved for those patients with verapamil ingestion who have progression of  symptoms,  refractory  to  optimal  medical  management. *Calcium  chloride  provides  three  times  as  much  elemental  calcium  as  calcium gluconate; it should be used with caution in cases of digoxin toxicity.

SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

# ■ ANTIhYpErTENSIVES

Commonly available antihypertensive agents include diuretics, clonidine, angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  and  angiotensin  II  receptor antagonists (Table 108-7). Acute overdose of diuretics are not expected to result in life-threatening clinical toxicity.

# Clinical Features

Thiazides and loop diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) can cause mild hypotension, tachycardia, and hypokalemia.

Begin regular insulin infusion at 1 U/kg/h.

Supplemental dextrose [10% solution (0.1 g/mL) in water at 200 mL/h (adult) or 5 mL/kg/h (pediatric)] may be required.

Monitor serum glucose every 20 minutes. Titrate dextrose infusion rate to maintain serum glucose level between 150 and 300 mg/dL.

Once infusion rates have been stable for 60 minutes, glucose monitoring may be decreased to hourly.

# ■ PHENYTOIN

Intentional  phenytoin  overdose  rarely  leads  to  death,  provided  adequate supportive care is administered. Most phenytoin-related deaths have been caused by rapid IV administration and hypersensitivity reactions. Phenytoin toxicity may occur after single acute exposure, and also may occur in patients chronically using phenytoin. In patients using phenytoin, toxicity occurs  after  lesser  ingestions  because  a  large  quantity  of  phenytoin  is already present in the body.

# Clinical Features

The toxic effects of phenytoin depend on the duration of exposure, dosage taken, and route of administration. Life-threatening effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole are seen with IV administration and are likely secondary to the diluent, propylene glycol. Morbidity can be avoided by  slowing  the  rate  of  administration  during  infusion.  Extravasation  of phenytoin,  but  not  fosphenytoin,  may  result  in  catastrophic  injury  with significant loss of soft tissue or even loss of digits or the hand.

Clinical  manifestations  in  overdose  are  typically  dose  related  and  are listed in Table 109-1. The primary clinical features of overdose are related to acute CNS effects while cardiovascular toxicity almost exclusively results from IV administration. Supratherapeutic phenytoin levels commonly result

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is made by history, clinical exam, and serum drug levels. The therapeutic range is 10 to 20 µg/mL and toxicity generally correlates with increasing  plasma  levels  (Table  109-2). Absorption  is  erratic,  and  serial levels  should  be  obtained  in  cases  of  suspected  ingestion.

include ataxia, nystagmus, miosis or mydriasis, ileus, bowel obstruction, hypertonicity,  increased  deep  tendon  reflexes,  dystonic  reactions,  and  an anticholinergic toxidrome. Severe toxicity may result in coma and respiratory failure, and seizures can occur at high serum concentrations. Though rare,  carbamazepine  can  widen  the  QRS  interval  and  cause  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Patients  taking  carbamazepine  therapeutically  will  develop toxicity with lesser acute ingestions because a large quantity of carbamazepine is already present in the body.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Serum carbamazepine concentrations do not correlate with severity of poisoning, though concentrations > 40 µg/mL may be associated with an increased risk of complications, and those more than 60 to 80 µg/mL may be fatal. A false-positive tricyclic antidepressant result on urine drug screen can occur.

Other findings include respiratory depression, hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and anion gap metabolic acidosis that may  persist  for  days.  Liver  toxicity,  cerebral  edema,  hyperammonemia, pancreatitis,  and  thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported  after  acute  overdose. Hepatic failure (microvesicular steatosis) occurs in about 1 in 20,000 patients on long-term therapy, with children < 3 years of age on multiple antiepileptics at greatest risk.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Obtain a serum valproate level. The therapeutic range is 50 to 100 µg/mL; adverse  effects  increase  at  concentrations > 150  µg/mL  and  frank  coma may occur with levels above 800 µg/mL. Check serum ammonia and bedside glucose in patients with altered level of consciousness. Consider liver function tests, electrolytes, and a CBC.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Iron toxicity from an intentional or accidental ingestion is a common poisoning. Based on clinical findings, iron poisoning can be divided into five stages.

The first stage develops within the first few hours of ingestion. Direct irritative effects of iron on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract produce abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Vomiting is the clinical sign most consistently associated with acute iron toxicity. The absence of these symptoms within 6  hours  of  ingestion  essentially  excludes  a  diagnosis  of  significant  iron toxicity.

During the second stage, which may continue for up to 24 hours following  ingestion,  the  patient's  GI  symptoms  may  resolve,  providing  a  false sense of security despite toxic amounts of iron absorption. While patients may be asymptomatic, they often appear ill and may have abnormal vital signs reflecting hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.

The third stage may appear early or develop hours after the second stage as shock and a metabolic acidosis evolve. Iron-induced coagulopathy may cause bleeding and worsen hypovolemia. Hepatic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and renal failure may also develop.

The fourth stage develops 2 to 5 days after ingestion and is characterized  by  elevation  of  aminotransferase  levels  and  possible  progression  to hepatic failure.

The fifth stage, which occurs 4 to 6 weeks after ingestion, reflects the corrosive effects of iron on the pyloric mucosa and may cause gastric outlet obstruction.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The diagnosis of iron poisoning is based on the clinical picture and the history provided by the patient, significant others, caretakers, or EMS providers. When determining a patient's potential for toxicity, the total amount of elemental iron must be used in calculations. Table 110-1 reviews the predicted clinical effects based on the amount of iron ingested.

Laboratory evaluation includes serum electrolytes, renal studies, serum glucose, coagulation studies, complete blood count, hepatic enzymes, and a  serum  iron  level. A  single  serum  iron  level  does  not  reflect  what  iron levels have been previously, what direction they are going, or the degree of iron toxicity in tissues; a single low serum level does not exclude the diagnosis of iron poisoning since there are variable times to peak level following ingestion of different iron preparations. Serum iron levels have limited use in directing management since toxicity is primarily intracellular rather than in the blood. The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) becomes falsely elevated in the presence of elevated serum iron levels or deferoxamine, and is of no clinical value.

Plain radiographs may reveal iron in the GI tract; however, many iron preparations are not radiopaque, so normal radiographs do not exclude iron ingestion.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Patients who have remained asymptomatic for 6 hours after ingestion of iron, have not ingested a potentially toxic amount, and who have a normal physical examination do not require medical treatment for iron toxicity. Patients whose symptoms resolve after a short period of time, and who have normal vital signs, usually have mild toxicity and require only supportive care. This subset of patients still requires an observation period. Figure 110-1 is an algorithm for the clinical management of patients after an acute iron ingestion.

Patients  who  are  symptomatic  or  demonstrate  signs  of  hemodynamic instability after iron ingestion require aggressive management in the ED.

with systemic toxicity, metabolic acidosis, worsening symptoms, or a serum iron level predictive of moderate to severe toxicity.

Intravenous  infusion  is  the  preferred  route  of deferoxamine administration because IM absorption is unpredictable in the hypovolemic patient. The recommended initial dose is 50 mg/kg in children to an adult dose of 1000 mg IV. Since hypotension is the rate-limiting factor  for  IV  infusion,  it  is  recommended  to  begin  with  a  slow  IV infusion  at  5 mg/kg/h.  The  deferoxamine  infusion  rate  can  be increased  to  15 mg/kg/h,  as  tolerated,  within  the  first  hour  of  treatment. The recommended total amount of deferoxamine is 360 mg/kg or 6 g during the first 24 hours. Initiate deferoxamine therapy without waiting  for  the  serum  iron  level  in  any  clinically  ill  patient  with  a known iron ingestion.

Evaluate the efficacy of deferoxamine treatment through serial urine samples. As ferrioxamine is excreted, urine changes to a classic vin rose appearance. Clinical recovery is the most important factor guiding the termination of deferoxamine therapy.

Products containing hydrocarbons are found in many household and workplace settings and include fuels, lighter fluids, paint removers, pesticides, polishers,  degreasers,  and  lubricants.  Some  volatile  substances  may  be recreationally  abused.  Exposure  may  cause  mild  to  severe  toxicity  and, rarely, sudden death.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Toxicity depends on route of exposure, physical characteristics, chemical characteristics, and the presence of toxic additives (e.g., lead or pesticides). See Table 111-1 for clinical features.

Chemical  pneumonitis  is  the  most  common  pulmonary  complication and is most likely to occur following aspiration of a hydrocarbon with low viscosity  (ability  to  resist  flow),  high  volatility  (tendency  for  a  liquid  to become  a  gas),  and  low  surface  tension  (cohesive  force  between  molecules). Symptoms occur quickly and include cough, gagging, choking, and dyspnea. Physical examination may reveal tachypnea, wheezing, grunting, and  an  elevated  temperature.  Radiographic  abnormalities  do  not  always occur. If radiographic findings occur, they may lag behind the clinical picture by 4 to 24 hours, but most are apparent within 6 hours.

Cardiac toxicity manifests as potentially lethal dysrhythmias resulting from myocardial sensitization to circulating catecholamines ('sudden sniffing  death  syndrome').  Halogenated  hydrocarbon  solvents  are  most  frequently implicated, but all classes of hydrocarbons have been associated with dysrhythmias.

--- [TABLE DETECTED] ---

System | Clinical Manifestations
Pulmonary | Tachypnea, grunting respirations, wheezing, retractions

SECTION 11: Toxicology and Pharmacology

Central  nervous  system  toxicity  may  present  as  intoxication,  ranging from  initial  giddiness,  agitation,  and  hallucinations  to  seizures,  slurred speech,  ataxia,  and  coma.  Chronic  exposure  may  cause  recurrent  headaches, cerebellar ataxia, and mood lability.

Gastrointestinal toxicity can include vomiting (which can lead to aspiration),  abdominal  pain,  anorexia,  and  hepatic  damage  (particularly  from halogenated  hydrocarbons  such  as  carbon  tetrachloride,  methylene  chloride, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene).

Dermal toxicity includes contact dermatitis and blistering with progression  to  full-thickness  burns.  Injection  of  hydrocarbons  can  cause tissue necrosis. Burns can result after cutaneous contact with hot tar and asphalt.

Less  common  acute  toxicities  include  hematologic  disorders  such  as hemolysis,  methemoglobinemia,  carboxyhemoglobinemia  (from  methylene chloride), and renal dysfunction.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Diagnosis is made by history and physical examination findings, bedside monitoring,  laboratory  tests,  and  chest  radiograph. An  abdominal  radiograph  may  reveal  ingestion  of  radiopaque  substances  (e.g.,  chlorinated hydrocarbons).

Table 111-2 | Management of hydrocarbon Exposures
Airway and breathing | Secure airway. Antidotes: Administer oxygen for carboxyhemoglobinemia and methy- lene blue for methemoglobinemia. Provide supplemental oxygen if wheezing. Administer inhaled β 2 -agonists if wheezing. Ventilatory support: Provide positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure as needed to achieve adequate oxygenation.
Cardiac | Circulation: Administer IV crystalloid fluid for initial volume resuscitation of hypotensive patients. Do not use catecholamines in cases of halogenated hydrocarbon exposure. Consider propranolol, esmolol, or lidocaine for ventricular dysrhythmias induced by halogenated hydrocarbon exposure. Consult the poison control center, toxicologist, and other appropriate specialists as needed.
Decontamination | Dermal: Remove hydrocarbon-soaked clothes, decontaminate skin with soap and water, and decontaminate eyes with saline irrigation. GI: Not indicated.
Other | Laboratory tests: Order CBC, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests (serum transaminase, bilirubin, albumin levels), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, carboxyhemoglobin level, methemoglobin level, and/or radiologic studies as indicated (see the text).

Caustics are substances that can cause histological and functional damage on contact and include both alkalis (pH > 7) and acids (pH < 7). The most common alkali exposure  is  household  bleach  (sodium  hypochlorite  with hydroxide), which is usually benign except in intentional ingestions. The most common acid exposures are drain cleaners (sulfuric acid), automobile batteries, and masonry cleaners (hydrochloric acid).

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Common features of caustic  ingestions  include  dysphagia,  odynophagia, epigastric pain, and vomiting with gastrointestinal (GI) tract injuries. Dysphonia, stridor, and respiratory distress can be seen with laryngotracheal injury. Esophageal injuries are graded by direct endoscopic visualization: (1)  edema  and  hyperemia;  (2)  ulcerations,  blisters,  and  exudates  (2anoncircumferential; 2b-circumferential); (3) deep ulceration and necrosis. Intentional ingestions are associated with higher-grade injury that can lead to  the  development  of  strictures.  Most  ingestions  with  serious  injury  are symptomatic with stridor, drooling, or vomiting, although distal GI injury without oral or facial burns is possible. Disc battery ingestions are often asymptomatic, though batteries > 15 mm in diameter can become lodged in the esophagus and cause pressure necrosis.

Caustic exposures to the cornea are particularly serious if they involve alkalis. Dermal exposures to caustics usually produce only local pain and irritation. However, alkali and sodium hydrofluoric acid burns can penetrate deeply. Alkali exposures lead to liquefactive necrosis, which is more severe than the coagulation necrosis caused by most acids. Hydrofluoric acid can cause  systemic  hypocalcemia,  hypomagnesemia,  and  hyperkalemia  with subsequent ventricular dysrhythmias.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The diagnosis is clinical. Routine laboratory tests are recommended for severely affected patients and include electrolytes, assessment of acidbase  status,  and  monitoring  for  potential  gastrointestinal  bleeding. Monitor serum calcium and magnesium levels and perform an ECG in patients  with  hydrofluoric  acid  exposures,  especially  ingestions.  Consider chest and/or abdominal radiographs in symptomatic caustic ingestions to assess for free air or to investigate for foreign body in cases of suspected disc battery ingestion. Noncontrast CT of the chest and abdomen  may  be  useful  if  perforated  viscus  is  suspected,  especially  after ingestion  of  strong  acids.  Early  endoscopic  evaluation  (ideally < 12 hours after ingestion) is indicated for intentional caustic ingestions, and unintentional cases presenting with stridor, oral burns, vomiting, drooling, or inability to tolerate oral intake.

Pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, and rodenticides. In addition to active toxic ingredients, many pesticides also contain 'inert' products such as petroleum distillates, which may be toxic as well. Although the mainstay of treatment is supportive care, some antidotes are essential.

# ■ INSECTICIDES

# Clinical Features

Organophosphate insecticides include agents such as diazinon, acephate, malathion, parathion, and chlorpyrifos. Absorption occurs through ingestion,  inhalation  (e.g.,  nerve  gas  agents),  and  dermal  routes.  Toxicity  is produced through binding and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, causing excess accumulation of acetylcholine and stimulation of cholinergic receptors, of both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptor types. The muscarinic receptor agonism results in a cholinergic crisis known as 'SLUDGE' and 'DUMBELS' effects (Table 113-1).

Onset  of  symptoms,  ranging  from  minutes  to  hours,  varies  based  on amount and route of exposure. Most patients become symptomatic within 8 hours of acute exposure, though some fat-soluble agents (e.g., fenthion) can  cause  delayed  symptoms  with  dermal  exposure.  Nicotinic  receptor stimulation  leads  to  fasciculations  and  muscle  weakness,  which  is  most pronounced in the respiratory muscles, which leads to worsening of pulmonary dysfunction caused by bronchorrhea from muscarinic effects. Nicotinic effects  can  also  cause  tachycardia  and  mydriasis,  paradoxical  to  the

expected  muscarinic  cholinergic  effects.  Central  nervous  system  (CNS) effects, which often predominate in children, include tremor, restlessness, confusion, seizures, and coma.

A variety of subacute and chronic effects are associated with organophosphate insecticide  poisoning. An  intermediate  syndrome,  1  to  5  days after  acute  poisoning,  may  present  with  paralysis  or  weakness  of  neck, facial, and respiratory muscles, which can result in respiratory arrest if not treated.  Organophosphate-induced  delayed  neuropathy  can  occur  1  to  3 weeks after acute poisoning, resulting in a distal motor-sensory polyneuropathy with leg weakness and paralysis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Organophosphate poisoning is typically a clinical diagnosis based on the toxidrome and history of exposure (Table 113-1); laboratory cholinesterase assay can aid in confirmation. An ECG may be useful to monitor for prolonged QT, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in organophosphate poisoning.

Herbicides are agents used to kill weeds. In addition to intrinsic toxicity, they may also be packaged with surfactants or solvents with their own toxic effects. The most dangerous are bipyridyl herbicides, namely paraquat  and  diquat.  Nonbipyridyl  herbicides  and  their  treatments  are depicted in Table 113-4.

Paraquat is especially toxic with lethality seen with oral doses of 10 to 20 mL in an adult and 4 to 5 mL in children of 20% solution. Both agents are toxic via inhalation, dermal exposure, or ingestion. Due to their caustic properties, ulceration of skin and mucous membranes and gastrointestinal corrosion can occur. Paraquat ingestions result in renal, cardiac, and hepatic failure along with progressive pulmonary fibrosis from oxidative damage. Due to the latter, treatment often includes restriction of supplemental oxygen  except  for  severe  hypoxia.  Decontamination  of  skin  is  important  to prevent  continued  absorption.  Early  after  ingestion,  GI  decontamination with activated  charcoal,  fuller's  earth, or bentonite may  be  helpful. Charcoal hemoperfusion may remove paraquat. Because of poor prognosis, especially with paraquat ingestions, admit patients with ingestion for further observation and treatment.

# ■ rODENTICIDES

The  most  commonly  used  rodenticides  are  superwarfarins,  including brodifacoum,  difenacoum,  and  bromadiolone.  Coagulopathy  typically develops within 48 hours and lasts for weeks to months due to the long half-lives of these agents. Single small ingestions in children usually do not result in toxic effects. Acute intentional or repeated ingestions may present with  delayed  hemorrhage,  including  hematuria,  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage, or epistaxis. Screening for toxic effect can be performed with an INR obtained 24 to 48 hours after ingestion. If the INR is elevated ( > 2), then start oral vitamin K 1 , typically at doses of 20 mg/d in adults (1 to 5 mg for children), which can be continued for up to 10 months until the anticoagulant effect is cleared. Acute hemorrhage requires more aggressive therapy with volume replacement, fresh frozen plasma or four-factor prothrombin complex, IV vitamin K 1 ,  and  supportive  care.  Nonanticoagulant  rodenticides are described in Table 113-5.

# ■ LEAD POISONING

# Clinical Features

Lead poisoning manifests with signs and symptoms affecting a variety of organ systems (Table 114-1).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Suspect lead poisoning in any individual demonstrating a combination of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms (particularly children with encephalopathy), especially in the setting of anemia. A complete blood count (CBC) may demonstrate normocytic or microcytic anemia  with  hemolysis  and  basophilic  stippling;  however,  hematologic findings are neither sensitive nor specific for lead poisoning. Lead toxicity is confirmed by an elevated blood lead level, though results are often not immediately available. Radiographs may identify metaphyseal long-bone lead lines, radiopaque material in the GI tract, or retained bullet fragments. The  differential  diagnosis  of  toxicity  is  broad  and  includes  meningitis, encephalitis, metabolic abnormalities, hypoxia, drug intoxications, arsenic, mercury, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

pointes have been reported. Chronic poisoning causes peripheral neuropathy, malaise, and confusion. Skin findings include alopecia, hyperpigmentation, keratoses, and transverse white nail lines (Mees' lines).

# Diagnosis and Differential

An exposure history is most useful in identifying arsenic poisoning. However, consider the diagnosis in patients with hypotension preceded by profound vomiting and diarrhea. The CBC may demonstrate leukocytosis with acute poisoning. An ECG may show QT-interval prolongation. The diagnosis is confirmed by documenting an elevated 24-hour urine arsenic level. Other diagnoses to consider include gastroenteritis, septic shock, encephalopathy,  peripheral  neuropathy, Addison's  disease,  and  lead,  thallium,  or mercury poisoning.

Mercury is primarily absorbed via inhalation (especially with heating or vacuuming). Ingestions  of  elemental  mercury  are  nontoxic  in  those  with  normal  GI  tracts. Vapor exposure results in cough, fever, dyspnea, vomiting, and headache.

--- [END OF TABLE] ---

Acute  lung  injury  can  progress  to  respiratory  failure.  Classic  findings include  tremor,  rash,  and  hypertension. Inorganic  mercury is  used  as  a disinfectant and in manufacturing. Ingestion of inorganic mercury results in corrosive injury to the GI tract, with vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and GI bleeding early, followed by acute kidney injury. Organic mercury is found  in  some  fungicides  and  pesticides  and  can  be  absorbed  when ingested. Poisoning tends to occur with chronic exposures and results in profound central nervous system dysfunction.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A history of exposure to mercury is key to diagnosis and is confirmed by an elevated 24-hour urine mercury level when toxicity is due to elemental or inorganic mercury; an elevated whole blood mercury level is necessary in cases of organic mercury exposure. The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes causes of metal fume fever (elemental), encephalopathy or tremor (elemental/inorganic/organic), thyroid disease, metabolic encephalopathy, stroke, and tumor. Consider alternative causes of corrosive gastroenteritis  (ingestion  of  iron,  arsenic,  phosphorus,  acids,  and  alkalis)  if mercury salt ingestion is suspected.

There are over 50,000 hazardous chemicals used in various industrial processes throughout the United States. Exposures are inevitable and the emergency physician must be prepared to appropriately care for these patients. Material  Safety  Data  Sheets,  regional  poison  control  centers  and  medical toxicologists are valuable resources for information on specific hazards, optimal management, and patient disposition. Children and pregnant women are patient populations who require special attention, the former due to differences in respiratory, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal physiology and the latter requiring a focus on maternal care in order to optimize fetal well-being.

# ■ RESPIRATORY TOXINS

# Clinical Features

Phosgene, chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, and ammonia are significant respiratory  toxins  seen  in  industrial  exposures,  and  are  further  described  in Table 115-1. Hydrocarbons, cyanide, and carbon monoxide are also inhalational toxins that can have systemic effects.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Examine the upper airway for evidence of singed nasal hair, soot in the oropharynx, facial or oropharyngeal burns, stridor, hoarseness, dysphagia, cough, carbonaceous sputum, tachypnea, retractions, accessory muscle use, wheezing,  or  cyanosis.  Diagnostic  workup  includes  arterial  blood  gas analysis with carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, serum lactate concentration, chest radiography, electrocardiogram, and cardiac monitoring.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ PhOSGENE

# Clinical Features

Phosgene, once used in chemical warfare, is a precursor in the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, dyes, polyurethane, and pesticides. It is also produced when chlorinated fluorocarbons are heated, a potential danger for those who work in the refrigeration or air-conditioning industries. Initial symptoms include upper airway and mucous membrane irritation, with an accompanying odor of freshly mown hay. Upon reaching the lower airways, phosgene converts to carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid, in which the latter causes caustic injury, capillary leakage, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Clinically, this process is manifested as chest tightness and dyspnea. Pulmonary edema may be delayed up to 24 hours, while onset within 4 hours suggests a poor prognosis. Diagnosis is typically made on history of exposure and clinical symptoms.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ChLORINE

# Clinical Features

Chlorine is used in a variety of industrial and water treatment processes. It has a very characteristic acrid, pungent odor and may disperse as a dense green  yellow  gas.  Upon  exposure  to  water,  chlorine  acid  derivatives  are

produced, leading to irritation of the mucous membranes of the eyes and upper  airway.  With  increasing  exposure,  the  more  distal  airways  are affected, leading to pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may be delayed up to 6 hours.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ NITROGEN DIOXIDE

# Clinical Features

Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides are typically encountered in silo gas and military ordinance, and are formed in any instance of air-based combustion. A triphasic clinical course is often observed, manifested initially as dyspnea and flu-like symptoms, followed by transient improvement, then increasing dyspnea 12 hours post-exposure due to pulmonary edema. Methemoglobinemia has also been reported. Diagnosis is typically  made  by clinical history.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ AMMONIA

# Clinical Features

Ammonia is found in many household chemicals, fertilizers, and plastic production.  It  has  a  characteristic  pungent  odor  and  rapidly  irritates  the mucous membranes of the upper airway. Lower airway injury may occur with massive exposure. Diagnosis is typically made by clinical history.

# ■ CYANIDE

# Clinical Features

Cyanide is an extremely toxic chemical generated during the combustion of synthetic materials, wool, and silk. It is used in vermin extermination, precious metal reclamation, and chemical laboratories. It is also found naturally in  seeds  of  the Prunus species.  Toxicity  is  caused  by  inhibition  of  cytochrome oxidase, which subsequently disrupts oxidative phosphorylation and ATP  production.  Patients  with  significant  exposure  present  with  altered consciousness,  hyperventilation,  hypotension,  and  bradycardia.  They  will typically have normal oxygen saturation on co-oximetry. A smell of bitter almonds may be detected. Cherry-red skin is an uncommon finding.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A  severe,  unexplained  anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis  is  characteristic  of cyanide  exposure  and  is  due  to  lactic  acid  production  from  anaerobic metabolism. The PaO 2 of venous blood will approach that of arterial blood as  a  result  of  impaired  tissue  oxygen  consumption. An  elevation  of  carboxyhemoglobin may also be seen in fire victims. Whole blood cyanide levels  confirm  exposure,  but  are  not  rapidly  available.  The  diagnosis  is made clinically and treatment initiated as soon as possible.

toxicity. However, nitrites are relatively contraindicated in hypotensive patients  with  an  uncertain  exposure  history  and  in  victims  of  smoke inhalation who may have concomitant carbon monoxide poisoning. The latter contraindication is due to reduced oxygen delivery from induced methemoglobinemia. In these instances, hydroxocobalamin is the ideal antidote; however, sodium thiosulfate may also be used while omitting the use of nitrites from the cyanide antidote kit.

# ■ hYDROGEN SULFIDE

# Clinical Features

Over-the-counter vitamin and herbal preparations are widely used and considered innocuous by most of the public. Many of these products, however, can produce significant toxicity, especially if used in excess. In addition, many patients neglect to mention or are reluctant to divulge that they are taking these products.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Hypervitaminosis most commonly occurs with supratherapeutic dosing, in part due to lack of public awareness of the harms of excessive use. Ingestion of large doses of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E can produce subacute or chronic toxicity. Water-soluble vitamins associated with toxicity include niacin, pyridoxine, and vitamin C. Common symptoms of vitamin toxicities are listed in Table 116-1.

--- [TABLE DETECTED] ---

Many popular herbal preparations have potential for serious toxicity and  medication  interactions,  despite  being  considered  by  many  to  be natural and safe alternatives to Western pharmaceuticals. Lack of regulation  of  these  products  raises  the  potential  for  toxic  contaminants  that may independently cause acute poisoning. While generally safe, chamomile, glucosamine, and Echinacea rarely cause anaphylaxis. Other commonly used agents, their uses, and associated adverse events are listed in Table 116-2.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Diagnosis is usually made clinically. A history of massive acute ingestion  or  chronic  supratherapeutic  use  should  be  sought.  Laboratory studies  that  may  be  helpful  include  a  complete  blood  count,  basic metabolic panel, hepatic enzymes, coagulation studies, bleeding time, creatine  phosphokinase,  toxicology  screen,  and  urine  pregnancy  test. An ECG may be indicated if signs of sympathomimetic stimulation are present.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Basic supportive care and discontinuation of the vitamin or herbal preparation are usually all that are needed to treat mild toxicity.

Dyshemoglobinemias result from the alteration of the hemoglobin molecule, which prevents it from carrying oxygen. Carboxyhemoglobin is created following exposure to carbon monoxide, which is usually considered an environmental emergency and is discussed in Chapter 127. Table 117-1 lists common pharmaceuticals capable of causing the formation of methemoglobin.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Methemoglobinemia presents with grayish-brown discoloration of the skin that is recognized as cyanosis. Children up to the age of 4 months lack the enzyme activity that normally reduces methemoglobin, thus making them susceptible to oxidant stress-induced methemoglobinemia. Three scenarios occur  with  some  frequency:  children  with  acute  gastroenteritis  and increased nitrate production from bacteria in the GI tract; children exposed to nitrates in water of agricultural areas where fertilizer runoff contaminates water  sources;  and  overconsumption  of  nitrogenous  vegetables  such  as spinach.

In  drug-induced  methemoglobinemia,  the  slate-gray  to  blue  discoloration of the skin is apparent with levels of 10% to 15%. Symptoms occur in proportion to declining oxygen delivery. Headache, nausea, and fatigue

occur at lower levels (20% to 30%). Levels above 50% can cause loss of consciousness, myocardial ischemia, dysrhythmias, seizures, and metabolic acidosis. Levels above 70% may be lethal. In patients with cardiopulmonary disease in which there is impaired oxygen delivery, the symptoms will be manifested at lower methemoglobin levels.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  diagnosis  of  methemoglobinemia  should  be  considered  in  patients presenting with cyanosis that does not improve with administration of oxygen.  During  venipuncture,  blood  may  appear  chocolate  brown,  a  visible effect that is easily identified when the blood is placed on filter paper with a  normal  patient's  blood  for  comparison.  Levels  are  measured  by  cooximetry on an arterial blood gas analyzer, with either an arterial or venous sample.  Standard  pulse  oximetry  will  give  an  erroneously  high  oxygen saturation level at approximately 85% and does not change despite administration  of  100%  oxygen.  Pulse  co-oximeters  are  available  that  can noninvasively measure both methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Methemoglobinemia  should  be  treated  initially  with  close  monitoring and high concentrations of inspired oxygen (Table 117-2). Methemoglobinemia at levels above 25% and symptomatic patients with lower levels should be treated with methylene blue .  The  initial  dose  of  methylene blue is 1 to 2 mg/kg as a 10% solution IV, given over 15 minutes. Clinical improvement should occur within 20 minutes, after which the dose may be  repeated  if  improvement  has  not  occurred.  Failure  to  respond  to  a second dose is usually due to one of five causes (in order or likelihood of occurrence):

# Environmental Injuries

# ■ NONFREEZING COLD INJURIES

Trench foot is a direct soft tissue injury that results from prolonged exposure to nonfreezing cold and moisture. The foot is initially pale, mottled, pulseless, and anesthetic and does not improve quickly with rewarming. Several hours after rewarming, the foot becomes hyperemic and painful as perfusion returns after 2 to 3 days. Bullae and edema are late findings. Anesthesia may persist for weeks or even permanently. Hyperhidrosis and sensitivity to cold are late features and may last for months to years. Chilblains (pernio) are painful  inflammatory  lesions  typically  affecting  the  ears,  hands,  and  feet caused by chronic exposure to intermittent damp, nonfreezing conditions. Localized edema, erythema, and cyanosis appear up to 12 hours after the exposure and are accompanied by pruritis and burning paresthesias. Tender blue nodules may form after rewarming and can persist for several days. Treatment of trench foot and chilblains includes drying, elevation, warming, and bandaging of the affected body part. With chilblains, add nifedipine 20 mg PO three times daily, pentoxifyline 400 mg PO three times daily, or limaprost 20 μ g  PO three times daily, as well as topical corticosteroids, such as 0.025% fluocinolone cream .

# ■ FROSTBITE

# Clinical Features

Freezing of tissue causes frostbite. Patients initially complain of stinging, burning,  and  numbness.  Frostbite  injuries  are  classified  by  the  depth  of injury and amount of tissue damage based on appearance after rewarming. First-degree  frostbite  (frostnip)  is  characterized  by  partial  thickness  skin freezing, erythema, edema, lack of blistering, and no tissue loss. Seconddegree frostbite is characterized by deeper, full-thickness skin freezing and results in the formation of clear bullae. The patient complains of numbness, followed by aching and throbbing. Deep cold injury or third-degree frostbite involves freezing of the skin and subdermal plexus leading to hemorrhagic bullae  and  skin  necrosis.  Fourth-degree  frostbite  extends  into  muscle,

tendon, and bone with mottled skin, nonblanching cyanosis, and eventual dry, black, mummified eschar formation. Early injuries are better classified as superficial or deep because it is difficult to initially evaluate the depth of injury. Laboratory testing and imaging are not needed to diagnose frostbite.

# Treatment

# ■ hYpOThERMIa

Hypothermia,  a  core  body  temperature  of < 35°C ( < 95°F),  results  from heat loss through conduction, convection, radiation, or evaporation.

# Clinical Features

The features of hypothermia represent a continuum. Mild hypothermia (32°C to 35°C [90°F to 95°F]) can present with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, shivering, and a normal level of consciousness. As core temperatures fall below 32°C (90°F), shivering ceases and heart rate and blood pressure decrease.  As  temperature  decreases  further,  patients  become  confused, lethargic,  and  then  comatose.  Pupillary  reflexes  are  lost.  Respiratory  rate decreases, gag and cough reflexes are diminished, and bronchorrhea occurs. Aspiration is common. Impaired renal concentration results in a cold diuresis and  hemoconcentration.  The  cardiac  effects  of  worsening  hypothermia progress from sinus bradycardia, to atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, to ventricular fibrillation, to asystole.  At temperatures < 32°C ( < 90°F), the risk for dysrhythmias increases. As core body temperature falls below 28°C (below  82°F),  the  risk  for  cardiac  arrest  increases  as  the  potential  for malignant cardiac dysrhythmias become more pronounced.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of hypothermia is based on core temperature and may not be initially obvious, especially in cases where a history of prolonged environmental  exposure  is  missing.  Low-reading  thermometers  are  required  to measure and monitor temperature. Along with the history and physical exam, laboratory investigation is directed at determining the underlying cause and complications.  Helpful  laboratory  studies  may  include  glucose,  complete blood  count  (CBC),  electrolytes,  thyroid-stimulating  hormone,  random

cortisol level, clotting profile, lactic acid, lipase, creatinine, blood gas, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Acid-base disorders are common, but do not follow a predictable pattern. Intravascular thrombosis, embolism, and disseminated intravascular  coagulation  (DIC)  may  occur.  Electrocardiographic  changes include PR, QRS, and QT prolongations, T-wave inversion, and a slow positive deflection at the end of the QRS (Osborn J wave). In addition to environmental exposure, causes of hypothermia include hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypopituitarism, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, drug intoxication, sepsis, and dermal disease.

--- Page 675 ---

Heat-related illness is a spectrum of disease ranging from minor heat disorders, such as prickly heat and heat cramps, to severe heat imbalance that results in life-threatening heat stroke.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

# Malignant Heat Illnesses

Heat stroke develops in the setting of unmitigated heat imbalance. The cardinal  features  are  hyperthermia  (core  temperature > 40°C  [104°F]) and  end-organ  injury.  Height  of  the  temperature  and  duration  of  heat exposure dictate degree of injury. Neural tissue, hepatocytes, nephrons, and  vascular  endothelium  are  most  sensitive  to  heat  stress.  Prominent neurologic abnormalities include confusion, agitation, bizarre behavior, ataxia, seizures, and coma. Other bedside findings include hyperventilation,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  and  oliguria. Anhidrosis  or  profuse  sweating may  be  seen.  When  coagulopathy/DIC  develops,  patients  may  have purpura, hemoptysis, or GI bleeding.

Heat stroke is further classified as exertional and nonexertional. Physical  activity  during  high  heat/humidity  produces  exertional  heat  stroke. Evaporation is the principal mechanism of heat loss, but is ineffective when humidity exceeds 75%. Nonexertional heat stoke is seen in the debilitated, chronically ill, and persons who are otherwise unable to escape from hot environments (e.g., closed vehicles, heavily bundled in crib, or isolated in a hot residence).

# Minor Heat Illnesses

Heat syncope results from volume depletion, peripheral vasodilation, and decreased  vasomotor  tone.  It  occurs  most  commonly  in  the  elderly  and poorly  acclimatized  individuals.  Postural  vital  signs  may  or  may  not  be demonstrable on presentation to the emergency department. Exclude other causes of syncope.

Heat cramps are characterized by painful muscle spasms, especially in the calves, thighs, and shoulders during athletic events. They usually occur when individuals replace evaporative losses with free water but not with salt. Core body temperature may be normal or elevated.

Heat edema and heat rash are usually self-limited symptoms during the first few days of heat exposure and are characterized by swelling of dependent extremities (e.g., hands and feet) or rash found commonly over clothed areas of the body.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  differential  diagnosis  includes  infection  (e.g.,  sepsis,  meningitis, encephalitis, malaria, typhoid, tetanus), endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis,  thyroid  storm),  neurologic  disorders  (e.g.,  cerebrovascular

655

SECTION 12: Environmental Injuries

accident, status epilepticus), and toxicologic causes (e.g., amphetamines for ADHD, dietary supplements, anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, salicylates, serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal).

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

# Malignant Heat Illnesses

Acute care requires accurate identification of hyperthermia with end-organ injury and rapid mitigation of the heat imbalance. Initial diagnostic studies are  directed  at  detecting  end-organ  damage  and  excluding  other  disease processes.  Early  laboratory  abnormalities  associated  with  heat  stroke include  hypoglycemia,  hypophosphatemia,  hypokalemia,  elevated  liver enzymes, hypercalcemia, elevated hematocrit along with elevated creatine phosphokinase  and  myoglobin  from  rhabdomyolysis.  Laboratory  abnormalities of DIC and renal failure may develop with time. Obtain an EKG and CXR. Neuroimaging studies and other evaluations (e.g., septic workup, toxicology screens) can be individualized as clinically indicated.

# Minor Heat Illnesses

Symptoms usually resolve independent of treatment and patients are typically discharged home. Heat edema treatment consists of elevation of the extremities  or  compressive  stockings.  Diuretics  may  exacerbate  volume depletion and should be avoided. Heat rash may improve with antihistamines,

# ■ WASPS, BEES, AND STINGING ANTS (HYMENOPTERA)

Wasps,  bees,  and  stinging  ants  are  members  of  the  order  Hymenoptera. Local  and  generalized  reactions  may  occur  in  response  to  an  encounter. Systemic  toxicity  may  result  from  an  allergic  reaction  or  from  massive envenomation  as  occurs  classically  with  the  so-called  Africanized  bees, which often attack  in  large  numbers.  Fire  ant  venom  may  cross-react  in individuals sensitized to other Hymenoptera stings.

# Clinical Features

Local reactions consist of pain, erythema, edema, and pruritus at the sting site. Severe local reactions may increase the likelihood of serious systemic reactions if the patient is reexposed. The local reaction to a fire ant sting consists  of  a  sterile  pustule  that  evolves  over  6  to  24  hours,  sometimes resulting in necrosis and scarring. Systemic reactions may include urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, and bronchospasm. In addition, those with massive envenomation may develop severe vomiting, diarrhea, rhabdomyolysis, myocardial  injury,  hepatic  failure,  and  renal  failure. Delayed  reactions , which  manifest  5  to  14  days  post-envenomation,  infrequently  occur,  but resemble serum sickness. Such illness is characterized by fever, malaise, headache, urticaria, lymphadenopathy, and polyarthritis.

CHAPTER 120: Bites and Stings

659

# ■ BROWN RECLUSE SPIDER ( LoxosceLes recLusa )

# Clinical Features

The initial L. reclusa bite  is  painless. It evolves into a firm erythematous lesion that heals over several days to weeks. Occasionally, a severe reaction with  immediate pain, hemorrhagic blister formation, and local blanching may occur. These lesions often become necrotic over the next 3 to 4 days and form significant eschars. Loxoscelism is  a  common systemic reaction following the bite of some South American Loxosceles species, but occurs infrequently following the bite of L. reclusa . Systemic symptoms, which are more common in children, typically occur 1 to 3 days post-envenomation, and are characterized by fever, chills, vomiting, arthralgias, myalgias, petechiae,  and  hemolysis.  Severe  cases  progress  to  seizures,  renal  failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Loxosceles species  are  distinguished  by  three  sets  of  paired  eyes;  most other spiders have eight eyes in two rows. A pigmented, violin-shaped pattern on the cephalothorax of the brown recluse is characteristic but unreliable. The diagnosis of L. reclusa envenomation is commonly clinical since the bite is rarely witnessed. Assays to confirm L. reclusa poisoning are not clinically  available.  Patients  with  significant  envenomation  may  exhibit hemolysis, coagulopathy, or abnormal renal function. Local abscesses are frequently misdiagnosed as Loxosceles envenomation

# ■ HOBO SPIDER ( TeGeNarIa aGresTIs )

The  hobo  spider,  also  known  as  the  Northwestern  brown  spider,  causes clinical signs and symptoms that are similar to those of the brown recluse spider bite. The skin site is initially painless before developing induration, erythema, blistering, and necrosis. Patients may experience headache, vomiting, and fatigue. There is no specific diagnostic test or therapeutic intervention for hobo spider bites. Surgical repair for severe ulcerative lesions is delayed until the necrotizing process is complete.

# ■ BLACK WIDOW SPIDER ( LaTrodecTus macTaNs )

# Clinical Features

Black widow spider bites induce an immediate pinprick sensation that may quickly spread to the entire extremity. Erythema at the site appears within 1  hour  and  often  forms  a  'target'  lesion.  Systemic  manifestations  may include  diffuse  myalgias,  especially  involving  the  larger  muscle  groups, including the back, abdomen, and trunk. Severe pain may wax and wane for several days. Other signs and symptoms include hypertension, tachycardia, muscle  fasciculations,  headache,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diaphoresis.  The fasciculations and diaphoresis may be localized or diffuse. Serious, albeit rare, acute complications include myocarditis, priapism, and dyspnea.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ TARANTULAS

When  threatened,  tarantulas  may  flick  barbed  hairs  into  their  victim. Although North American tarantula hairs rarely penetrate human skin, they can embed deeply into the conjunctiva and cornea and cause an inflammatory response. Any patient complaining of ocular symptoms after exposure to a tarantula should undergo a thorough slit lamp examination to search for embedded hairs. Treatment includes topical steroids and consultation with an ophthalmologist for surgical removal of the hairs.

Tarantula bites may also occur. They are painful, and cause local erythema and edema. Provide local wound care and analgesia.

# ■ SCORPION (SCORPIONIDA)

# Clinical Features

Although highly toxic species are found in the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa, the  only  North American scorpion that produces systemic toxicity is the bark  scorpion  ( Centruroides  sculpturatus ).  Venom  from C.  sculpturatus causes immediate pain and paresthesia. A positive 'tap test' (exquisite local tenderness when the area is lightly tapped) may be seen. Systemic effects are relatively infrequent and occur mainly in children. Systemic manifestations include diffuse motor involvement and/or cranial nerve dysfunction, the latter of which may result in roving eye movements, diplopia, and difficulty swallowing. Systemic symptoms may last 24 to 48 hours without antivenom therapy.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ SCABIES ( sarcoPTes scaBIeI )

# Clinical Features

Scabies bites are often concentrated in the web spaces between fingers and toes. Other common areas include the axilla and genital area, children's faces and scalps, and the female nipple. Transmission is typically by direct contact. The distinctive feature of scabies infestation is intense pruritus with 'burrows.' The female mite is easily scraped out with a blade edge. Associated vesicles, papules, crusts, and eczematization may obscure the diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Advise  patients  to  apply  permethrin  cream  from  the  neck  down;  infants may require additional application to the scalp, temple, and forehead. The patient  should  bathe  before  application,  apply  the  medication,  and  then bathe again in 12 hours. Reapplication is necessary only if mites are found 2 weeks after treatment, although the pruritus may last for several weeks after successful therapy. Ivermectin , 200 μ g/kg PO, followed by a second dose in 10 days, is an alternative treatment.

# ■ TICKS

The spectrum of tick borne illness includes Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, tularemia, and tickborne encephalitis. Certain species of ticks have a neurotoxin capable

--- Page 682 ---

662 SECTION 12: Environmental Injuries

of inducing tick paralysis, a symmetric ascending flaccid paralysis nearly identical  to  Guillain-Barré  syndrome.  Indeed,  a  diagnosis  of  GuillainBarré syndrome should not be considered until a thorough search rules out the  presence  of  an  engorged  tick.  The  recommended  method  of  tick removal involves grasping the tick with forceps near the point of attachment and pulling with steady, gentle traction. Since disease transmission is time dependent, prompt tick removal is essential.

# ■ CHIGGERS (TROMBICULIDAE)

# Clinical Features

Chiggers are tiny mite larvae that cause intense pruritus when they feed on host  epidermal  cells. They  tend  to  attach  to  skin  in  areas  of  tight-fitting clothing such as near waistbands. Children who have been sitting on lawns are prone to chigger lesions in the genital area. Itchiness begins within a few hours, followed by a papule that enlarges to a nodule ('chigger bite') over the next 1 to 2 days. Single bites may cause soft tissue edema, whereas infestation has been associated with fever and erythema multiforme. The diagnosis  of  chigger  bites  is  based  on  typical  skin  lesions  and  intense pruritus in the context of known outdoor exposure.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment is symptomatic with oral or topical antihistamines, although oral steroids may be required in more severe cases. Annihilation of the mites requires topical application of permethrin or other topical scabicides. The package insert provides techniques for proper use.

# ■ FLEAS (SIPHONAPTERA)

Flea bites are frequently found in zigzag lines, especially on the legs and waist.  They  are  intensely  pruritic  lesions  with  hemorrhagic  puncta,  surrounding  erythema,  and  urticaria.  Discomfort  is  relieved  with  calamine lotion, cool soaks, and oral or topical antihistamines. Severe irritation may require  topical  steroid  creams.  Patients  who  develop  impetigo  and  other local infections should be treated with topical or oral antibiotics.

# ■ LICE (ANOPLURA)

Body lice concentrate on the waist, shoulders, axillae, and neck. Their bites produce  red  spots  that  progress  to  papules  and  wheals.  They  are  so intensely pruritic that linear scratch marks are suggestive of infestation. The white ova of head lice are adherent to the hair shaft and therefore can be distinguished from dandruff. Pubic lice are spread by sexual contact. They cause intense pruritus, and their small white eggs (nits) are visible on hair shafts. As with scabies, permethrin is the primary treatment for body lice infestation. Treatment of any hair-borne infestation requires application of pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide after hair washing, with reapplication in 10 days. Wet combing hair with a fine-tooth comb will remove dead lice and nits. Clothing, bedding, and personal articles should be washed in hot ( > 52°C [125.6°F]) water to prevent reinfestation.

CHAPTER 120: Bites and Stings

663

# ■ KISSING BUGS AND BED BUGS (HEMIPTERA)

Kissing bugs, also known as reduviid or conenose beetles, and bed bugs feed on blood of a sleeping victim. The initial bite is painless. Bedbug bites are  often  linear.  Bites  are  often  multiple  and  result  in  wheals  or  hemorrhagic papules and bullae. Dark lines of bedbug excrement on bed linens may be seen. Treatment consists of local wound care, topical steroids, and oral antihistamines. Allergic reactions may occur in sensitized individuals.

# ■ SNAKE BITES

Venomous snake bites in North America are typically caused by pit vipers (Crotaline-rattlesnakes, copperhead, water moccasin, and massasauga) or coral snakes (Elapidae).

# ■ PIT VIPER (CROTALINAE) BITES

Crotaline snakes, commonly known as pit vipers, are identified by their two retractable fangs and by heat-sensitive depressions ('pits') located bilaterally  between  each  eye  and  nostril.  Only  25%  of  bites  result  in envenomation.

# Clinical Features

The effects of crotaline envenomation depend on the size and species of snake, the age and size of the victim, the time elapsed since the bite, and the characteristics of the bite itself. The hallmark of pit viper envenomation is the presence of one or more fang marks combined with pain, and progressive  edema  extending  from  the  site. Tender  lymphadenopathy  in the envenomated extremity is common. Nausea, vomiting, and a metallic taste  are  often  described  in  those  patients  with  envenomations.  Severe systemic manifestations may rarely occur, and include hypotension, tachycardia, and shock. Thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypofibrinogenemia may be observed.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of crotaline envenomation is based on the presence of the aforementioned local injuries, systemic symptoms or hematologic abnormalities. The absence of any of these findings after 8 to 12 hours indicates a dry bite.

Minimal envenomation is defined as local swelling, no systemic signs, and  no  laboratory  abnormalities. Severe envenomation  causes  extensive swelling, potentially life-threatening systemic signs, and markedly abnormal coagulation parameters. Initially mild envenomation syndromes may progress to severe syndromes over several hours. Pertinent laboratory tests include a complete blood count, coagulation tests, urinalysis, and blood typing.

Venomous coral snakes in the United States are brightly colored with adjacent red and yellow bands. In the United States, only bites from the eastern coral  snake  ( Micrurus fulvius fulvius )  require  significant  treatment  as  its

venom  is  a  potent  neurotoxin  that  causes  tremor,  salivation,  respiratory paralysis, seizures, and bulbar palsies (e.g., dysarthria, diplopia, and dysphagia). Bites of the Sonoran (Arizona) coral snake are mild and only need local care.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ GILA MONSTER BITE

Gila monster bites result in pain and swelling. Systemic toxicity is rare but may  consist  of  diaphoresis,  paresthesia,  weakness,  hypertension,  and angioedema. The biting animal may be tenacious, and the reptile should be removed as soon as possible. If the reptile is still attached, it may loosen its bite  when placed on a solid surface where it is not suspended in midair. Once  removed,  perform  standard  wound  care  including  a  search  for implanted  teeth.  No  further  treatment  is  required.  Patients  should  be observed for airway edema for at least 6 hours after the Gila monster is removed. Those without systemic manifestations,  including  angioedema, can be discharged home.

The population growth along coastal areas has made exposure to hazardous marine fauna increasingly common. The popularity of home aquariums generates additional exposures inland. Marine fauna can inflict injury through  direct  traumatic  bite  or  envenomation,  usually  via  a  stinging apparatus.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Major marine trauma includes bites from sharks, great barracudas, moray eels,  seals,  crocodiles,  needlefish,  wahoos,  piranhas,  and  triggerfish. Shark bites may also cause substantial tissue loss, particularly the legs, with hemorrhagic shock. Minor trauma is usually due to cuts and scrapes from coral which can cause local stinging pain, erythema, urticaria, and pruritus.

Marine wounds can be infected with routine skin flora, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species,  along  with  bacteria  unique  to  the marine  environment.  The  most  serious  halophilic  organism  is  the  gramnegative bacillus Vibrio , which can cause rapid infections marked by pain, swelling, hemorrhagic bullae, vasculitis, and even necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis.  Immunosuppressed  patients,  particularly  those  with  liver  disease, are  susceptible  to  sepsis  and  death  (up  to  60%)  from Vibrio  vulnificus . Another  bacterium, Erysipelothrix  rhusiopathiae, implicated  in  fishhandler's disease, can cause painful, marginating plaques after cutaneous puncture wounds. The unique marine bacterium Mycobacterium marinum , an acid-fast bacillus, can cause a chronic cutaneous granuloma 3 to 4 weeks after exposure.

Numerous  invertebrate  and  vertebrate  marine  species  are  venomous. The invertebrates belong to five phyla: Cnidaria, Porifera, Echinodermata, Annelida, and Mollusca.

The four classes of Cnidaria all share stinging cells, known as nematocysts,  which  deliver  venom  subcutaneously  when  stimulated.  The  most common effect is local pain, swelling, pruritus, urticaria, and even blistering and necrosis in severe cases. Some can cause systemic reactions due to toxic effects. The Hydrozoans include hydroids, Millepora (fire corals), and Physalia (Portuguese man-of-war). The latter causes a linear erythematous eruption and rarely can cause respiratory arrest, possibly from anaphylaxis. In addition  to  local  tissue  injury,  the  Scyphozoans  (true  jellyfish)  include Atlantic  Ocean  larval  forms  that  can  cause  a  persistent  dermatitis  under bathing suits lasting days after exposure (Seabather's eruption). The Cubozoans  (box  jellyfish),  in  particular Chironex  fleckeri in  Australia  and Chiropsalmus in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  can  cause  a  cardiotoxic  death  after severe stings. A Hawaiian box jellyfish, Carybdea , has been implicated in painful  stings  but  no  deaths.  Another  Australian  box  jellyfish, Carukia barnesi ,  can  cause  Irukandji's  syndrome,  characterized  by  diffuse  pain,

666

CHAPTER 121: Trauma and Envenomation from Marine Fauna

667

hypertension,  tachycardia,  diaphoresis,  and  even  pulmonary  edema.  The most innocuous Cnidaria are the anthozoans (anemones) that occasionally cause a mild local reaction.

Porifera  (the  sponges)  can  produce  a  stinging,  pruritic  dermatitis. Spicules of silica or calcium carbonate can become embedded in the skin along with toxic secretions from the sponge. Echinodermata include sea urchins  and  sea  stars.  Sea  urchin  spines  produce  immediate  pain  with trauma;  some  contain  venom  that  leads  to  erythema  and  swelling. Retained  spines  can  lead  to  infection  and  granuloma  formation.  The crown-of-thorns sea star, Acanthaster planci , has sharp rigid spines that cause burning pain and local inflammation. Another class of echinoderms are  sea  cucumbers,  which  can  cause  mild  contact  dermatitis. Annelida include bristle and fire worms, which embed bristles in the skin, causing pain and erythema. Mollusca include gastropods and octopuses. Both the Indo-Pacific cone shell, Conus ,  and the blue-ringed octopus, Hapalochlaena ,  can  deliver  paralytic  venom  that  can  quickly  lead  to  respiratory paralysis.

Vertebrate envenomations are primarily due to stingrays (order Rajiformes)  and  spined  venomous  fish  (scorpion  fish,  lionfish,  catfish,  and weeverfish). The stingray whip tail has venomous spines, which puncture or lacerate causing an intense painful local reaction. The spines of venomous fish have glands that force venom into the wound after puncture and cause local pain, erythema, and edema. Retention of a spine tip can lead to infection.  In  tropical  Indo-Pacific  waters,  bites  by  venomous  sea  snakes, although  rare,  can  cause  neurotoxicity  and  myotoxicity,  and  even  death from ascending paralysis.

High-altitude  disorders  are  due  primarily  to  hypoxia;  the  rapidity  and height of ascent influence the risk of occurrence.

# ■ ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS

# Clinical Features

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is usually seen in nonacclimated people making  a  rapid  ascent  to  higher  than  2000  m  (6560  ft)  above  sea  level. Symptoms resembling a hangover may develop within 6 hours after arrival at  altitude  but  may  be  delayed  as  long  as  one  day.  Typical  symptoms include  bifrontal  headache  along  with  a  combination  of  GI  disturbance, dizziness,  fatigue,  or  sleep  disturbance.  Worsening  headache,  vomiting, oliguria,  dyspnea,  and  weakness  indicate  progression  of AMS.  Physical examination findings in early AMS are limited. Postural hypotension and peripheral and facial edema may occur. Localized rales are noted in up to 20% of cases. Funduscopy shows tortuous and dilated veins; retinal hemorrhages  are  common  at  altitudes  higher  than  5000  m  (16,500 ft).  Resting S a O 2 is typically normal for altitude and correlates poorly with the diagnosis of AMS.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The differential diagnosis includes hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning,  pulmonary  or  central  nervous  system  infections,  migraine,  dehydration,  and  exhaustion.  The  diagnosis  is  based  largely  on  history  of  rapid ascent and symptoms.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The goals  of  treatment  are  to  prevent  progression,  abort  the  illness,  and improve acclimatization.

symptoms  resolve  and dexamethasone 4  mg  PO,  IM,  or  IV  every 6 hours with a taper over several days.

# ■ hIGh-ALTITUDE pULMONArY EDEMA

Risk  factors  for  high-altitude  pulmonary  edema  (HAPE)  include  rapid ascent, heavy exertion, cold, pulmonary hypertension, and use of a sleep medication. Children with acute respiratory infections may be more susceptible to HAPE. HAPE may be fatal if not recognized and treated early.

# Clinical Features

HAPE usually begins on the second to fourth night at a new altitude and may progress quickly from dry cough and impaired exercise capacity to resting dyspnea, productive cough, severe weakness, and cyanosis. Physical  examination  findings  include  tachycardia,  tachypnea,  localized  or generalized rales, and signs of pulmonary hypertension, such as a prominent P 2 and right ventricular heave. Resting SaO 2 is  low for altitude and drops significantly with exertion. CXR abnormalities progress from interstitial to localized to generalized alveolar infiltrates. Right axis deviation and a right ventricular  strain  pattern  are  seen  on  EKG  with  progressive disease.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  differential  diagnosis  includes  pneumonia,  acute  asthma,  congestive heart  failure,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  pulmonary  embolism.  Decreased exercise performance and dry cough are enough to suspect early HAPE. A key to diagnosis is response to treatment.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Early  recognition  of  HAPE  is  essential  to  prevent  progression.  General measures include rest and keeping patients warm.

# ■ hIGh-ALTITUDE CErEBrAL EDEMA

# Clinical Features

High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is defined as progressive neurologic deterioration  with  AMS  or  HAPE.  Patients  present  with  altered  mental status, ataxia, stupor, and progress to coma if untreated. Focal neurologic signs such as third and sixth cranial nerve palsies may be present.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  differential  diagnosis  includes  stroke  or  transient  ischemic  attack, tumor,  meningitis,  encephalitis,  or  metabolic  disturbance.  Increased  T2 signaling in the splenium of the corpus callosum is seen on MRI. Laboratory testing to rule out other diagnoses may be considered but should not delay treatment.

Dysbarism is commonly encountered in scuba divers and refers to complications associated with changes in environmental ambient pressure and with breathing compressed gases. These effects are governed by three gas laws: Boyle's law states that pressure and volume are inversely related; Henry's law states that, at equilibrium, the quantity of gas in solution is proportional to  the  partial  pressure  of  that  gas;  Dalton's  law  states  that  total  pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Barotrauma is the most common diving-related affliction and is caused by the direct mechanical effects of pressure, as gas-filled cavities in the body contract or expand with pressure changes. The most common form of barotrauma occurs during descent and is middle ear squeeze, or barotitis media. It is caused by inability to equalize pressure causing tympanic membrane bleeding or rupture and may result in conductive hearing loss. A forceful Valsalva during equalization can cause inner ear barotrauma with rupture of the round or oval window. Symptoms include tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, and vertigo. If the sinus ostia are occluded on descent, an impending  squeeze  can  cause  bleeding  from  the  maxillary  or  frontal  sinuses, resulting in pain and epistaxis.

Barotrauma during ascent is due to expansion of gas in body cavities. In the middle ear, the pressure differential from asymmetrical expansion can cause alternobaric vertigo. Although rare, 'reverse squeeze' may affect the ear or sinuses during ascent with rupture. Pulmonary overinflation and even burst lung can occur during rapid, panicked ascents if divers fail to exhale or if intrinsic pulmonary air trapping exists (e.g., COPD) resulting in pneumomediastinum,  subcutaneous  emphysema,  or  pneumothorax.  The  most serious consequence is cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE). Neurologic symptoms occur on ascent or immediately upon surfacing and include loss of  consciousness,  seizure,  blindness,  disorientation,  hemiplegia,  or  other signs of stroke.

Divers using compressed air, caisson (tunnel) workers, and high-altitude pilots can all present with decompression sickness (DCS). In divers, this usually results from exceeding the dive table limits for depth and time. DCS can occur within minutes to hours of surfacing, rarely days later. Excessive bubble formation in tissue or circulation from saturated gas can cause both acute occlusive and delayed inflammatory effects. Type I DCS, 'pain-only,' includes mottled skin and deep pain of the joints, usually the shoulder or knee, and is unaffected by movement. Type II, 'serious,' DCS involves the central nervous system, typically the spine. Patients may initially complain of  truncal  constriction  with  ascending  paralysis.  Prolonged  exposure  at depth can lead to cardiopulmonary 'chokes' with cough and hemoptysis or vestibular  'staggers'  with  vertigo  and  hearing  loss.  Because  DCS  and

673

--- Page 694 ---

674

SECTION 12: Environmental Injuries

CAGE can be difficult to distinguish, or present simultaneously, the term 'decompression illness' is now typically used for both.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Dive profile (depth, duration, and repetitiveness) and time of symptom onset are the most useful historical factors in distinguishing dysbarism from other disorders. During descent, the most common maladies are the squeezes. A fistula test, insufflation of the tympanic membrane on the affected side causing the eyes to deviate to the contralateral side, may help diagnose inner ear barotrauma. During ascent, barotrauma or alternobaric vertigo is most likely to occur. A chest x-ray may reveal pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or subcutaneous  air  after  pulmonary  overinflation.  If  accompanied  by  early neurological  symptoms,  CAGE  should  be  considered.  Laboratory  testing may reveal elevated hematocrit from hemoconcentration or elevated creatine phosphokinase from circulatory distribution of bubbles.

The  differential  diagnosis  for  DCS  is  broad.  Musculoskeletal  complaints could be due to joint strain or symptomatic herniated cervical disk. Chest pain may represent cardiac ischemia from overexertion. Immersion pulmonary edema from noncardiogenic causes can occur during strenuous dives, particularly in cold water. Seizures at depth can result from breathing enriched mixtures of oxygen exceeding 1.4 atmospheres absolute. Regardless, DCS should be suspected in patients with vague pain or neurological symptoms especially if safe diving limits, depth and time, were exceeded. If DCS is suspected, an early trial of pressure with hyperbaric oxygen usually results in some improvement.

Drowning is submersion in a liquid resulting in respiratory distress or failure.  Prognosis  after  submersion  injuries  depends  on  the  degree  of pulmonary and central nervous system injury and, therefore, is highly dependent  on  early  rescue  and  resuscitation.  Prevention  is  the  most important means to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Up  to  20%  of  patients  who  suffer  submersion  injuries  do  not  aspirate water, but sustain injury due to asphyxia. Patients who aspirate water into their  lungs  have  washout of surfactant, resulting in diminished alveolar gas  transfer,  atelectasis,  ventilation  perfusion  mismatch,  and  hypoxia. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema results from moderate to severe aspiration.  Physical  examination  findings  at  presentation  vary.  Lungs  may  be clear or have rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. Mental status ranges from normal to comatose. Patients are at risk for hypothermia even in 'warm water' submersions.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Evaluate patients for associated injuries (e.g., traumatic injuries to the brain or spinal cord) and underlying precipitating disorders including syncope, seizures, hypoglycemia, and acute myocardial infarction or dysrhythmias. Respiratory acidosis may be present early followed by metabolic acidosis later. Early electrolyte disturbances are unusual. A chest radiograph (CXR) is usually obtained but is frequently normal in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. Without a history  of  diving  or  associated  trauma,  routine cervical immobilization and computerized tomography (CT) of the brain are not necessary.

# ■ THERMAL BURNS

The  majority  of  burn  patients  are  treated  and  released  from  the  ED.  Of those hospitalized, more than 60% are admitted to one of the country's 127 burn centers. The risk of death from a major burn is associated with larger burn size, advanced age, concomitant inhalation injury, and female sex.

# Clinical Features

Burns are categorized by their size and depth. Burn size is calculated as the percentage  of  body  surface  area  (BSA)  involved.  The  most  common method to estimate this is the Rule of Nines (Fig. 125-1). A more accurate tool, especially in infants and children, is the Lund and Browder burn diagram  (Fig.  125-2).  For  smaller  burns,  the  patient's  hand  can  be  used  to estimate the size of the burn. The area of the back of the patient's hand represents approximately 1% of BSA, and the number of 'hands' represents the BSA burned.

A more clinically relevant classification scheme categorizes burns as superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness, and full thickness.  Table  125-1  summarizes  the  characteristics  of  each  type  of burn.

Inhalation injury occurs most frequently in closed-space fires and in patients  with  decreased  cognition  (intoxication,  overdose,  head  injury). Both the upper and lower airway can be injured by heat, particulate matter, and toxic gases. Thermal injury is usually limited to the upper airway, and can result in acute airway compromise. Particulate matter can reach and

CHAPTER 125: Thermal and Chemical Burns

683

# Clinical Features

Clinical features depend on the type of agent, concentration, volume, duration of exposure, and extent of penetration. Alkalis usually produce more damage than acids. Acids typically cause coagulation necrosis, which produces  an  eschar  that  limits  further  damage. Alkalis  produce  liquefaction necrosis,  allowing  deeper  damage  to  occur.  Hydrofluoric  (HF)  acid  is  a special case as it rapidly penetrates intact skin and can cause progressive pain and deep tissue destruction without obvious superficial tissue damage. Systemic toxicity, including hypotension, acidosis, and shock, may occur if certain chemicals are absorbed.

Chemical  burns  of  the  eye  are  true  ocular  emergencies.  Acid  ocular burns quickly precipitate proteins in the superficial eye structures resulting in a 'ground glass' appearance of the cornea. Alkali ocular burns are more severe due to deeper ongoing penetration. Lacrimators (tear gas and pepper mace) cause ocular, mucous membrane, and pulmonary irritation.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of chemical burn usually is made by history of exposure to a chemical  agent.  Chemical  topical  exposures  should  be  considered  in  all cases  of  skin  irritation  and/or  pain.  For  ocular  exposures,  pH  paper  can distinguish alkali from acid exposure.

# ■ ELECTRICAL INJURIES

Electrical injuries occur with a wide spectrum of damage, from superficial skin burns to multisystem injury. Electrical injuries are arbitrarily classified as those of low voltage ( ≤ 1000  V) and high voltage ( > 1000  V).

# Clinical Features

Electricity-induced injuries can occur via several mechanisms: (1) direct tissue damage from the electrical energy, (2) tissue damage from thermal energy,  and  (3)  mechanical  injury  from  trauma  induced  by  a  fall  or muscle contraction. Patients may sustain immediate cardiac dysrthymias including ventricular fibrillation, respiratory arrest, or seizures. Cardiac complications are more commonly seen in high-voltage injuries. Temporary  loss  of  consciousness  is  common.  Severe  burns  may  result  from contact with high-voltage lines. The size of the skin injury does not correlate  well  with  internal  injuries.  Traumatic  injuries  frequently  accompany  electrical  injuries.  The  details  of  specific  immediate  and  delayed systemic injuries and complications are summarized in Table 126-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of electrical injury is usually based on the history of contact with an electrical source and the typical skin or oral lesions in children. However, patients with amnesia or any other type of altered mental status, with  no  skin  injuries,  must  undergo  an  interview  and  a  more  detailed physical examination, especially for possible thunderstorm incidents. Laboratory and radiographic evaluation of high-voltage injures should follow standard  trauma  guidelines.  Atrial  or  ventricular  arrhythmias,  bradyarrthymias, prolonged QT intervals or ST-T wave abnormalities may be noted on the ECG. An elevated serum CK, myoglobin or urine myoglobin suggests extensive muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis. Assessment and treatment of complications associated with electrical injuries are summarized in Table 126-2.

# ■ INJURIES DUE TO ELECTRONIC CONTROL DEVICES

Electronic  control  devices,  such  as  the  cattle  prod,  stun  gun,  and  the TASER ® , deliver high-voltage, low-amperage electrical pulses that induce involuntary muscle contraction, neuromuscular incapacitation, and/or pain. The likelihood of electrical injury is minimal. Injuries are usually limited to  superficial punctures, and minor lacerations and cutaneous burns. The majority of deaths that have followed the use of these devices have occurred in persons who were extremely ill and agitated due to psychosis, stimulant drugs,  or  other  conditions.  Ill-appearing  and  agitated  patients  should  be evaluated and treated in the same way as all patients who may have sustained  blunt  trauma  or  who  have  ingested  unknown  substances.  Cardiac monitoring and other testing are not needed just because a TASER ®  has been used.

# ■ LIGhTNING INJURIES

Lightning  is  a  unidirectional  extremely  high-voltage  current  that  causes substantially different injuries from those caused by high-voltage AC electricity. Lightning often travels over the skin, rather than through the body ( flashover ), which may explain why most people survive. However, a significant number may have permanent sequelae.

# Clinical Features

Clinical events occur at multiple levels due to the electric effect, the high temperature generated, and mechanical effects due to the shock wave. The

--- [END OF TABLE] ---

most common immediate cause of death after lightning strike is primary or secondary hypoxic cardiac arrest due to respiratory arrest. In the patient with spontaneous circulation, hypertension and tachycardia are caused by sympathetic  activation.  Patients  may  experience  temporary  loss  of  consciousness, confusion, and amnesia. Feathering or fern-shaped burns on the skin  are  pathognomonic  of  lightning  but  are  transient  and  rarely  seen. Tympanic membrane rupture may occur by blast effect. Deep tissue injuries, myoglobinuria, and renal failure are uncommon. The details of specific  immediate  and  delayed  systemic  injuries  and  complications  are summarized in Table 126-4.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of lightning injury is based on history and should be considered  in  any  critically  ill  patient  found  outside  during  or  after  a  thunderstorm. While increasingly rare, indoor exposures to lightning may occur via indoor pools, use of hard-wired telephones, or in poorly constructed structures. Carefully assess patients for neurologic and cardiovascular complications,  otologic  and  ophthalmologic  injuries,  and  blunt  trauma.  Burns  are uncommon.  Laboratory  and  radiographic  evaluation  of  lightning  injures should follow standard trauma guidelines. Differential diagnosis includes stroke  or  intracranial  hemorrhage,  seizure  disorder,  and  cerebral,  spinal cord, or other neurologic trauma.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, nonirritating gas that displaces oxygen  from  hemoglobin,  resulting  in  early  tissue  hypoxia  and  delayed neurologic damage. Sources of exposure to carbon monoxide include the incomplete combustion of any carbonaceous fuel (e.g., gasoline, kerosene, natural gas, and charcoal) or the metabolism of inhaled methylene chloride (paint stripper).

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

A  history  of  exposure  to  gas-  or  propane-powered  motors  or  heaters, smoke inhalation, or multiple victims with altered mental status, acidosis, or coma should alert one to the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. The clinical features of carbon monoxide poisoning are highly variable and primarily relate to hypoxic effects on the cardiovascular and neurologic systems (Table 127-1). Symptoms range from 'flu-like,' such as headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, to coma. The 'classic finding'  of  cherry  red  lips  is  rarely  seen  in  living  patients.  Patients  with significant poisoning may experience long-term neurological and cognitive problems.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Blood cooximetry is the most reliable test to diagnose carbon monoxide poisoning. Although elevated carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels confirm exposure, they do not necessarily correlate with symptoms or prognosis. Baseline  COHb  may  be  as  high  as  5%  in  nonsmokers  and  10%  in smokers. Higher levels are suggestive of CO exposure. The use of bedside pulse  cooximetry  in  the  ED  to  screen  for  CO  exposure  is  still  under investigation.

Standard pulse oximetry is unreliable in the presence of increasing COHb as oxygen saturation readings will be artificially high or normal. Additional  laboratory  and  imaging  abnormalities  seen  in  symptomatic patients  may  include  elevated  anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis,  elevated lactate, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated troponin, ECG changes consistent with ischemia, and bilateral globus pallidus lesions on brain imaging.

The differential diagnosis is wide due to the nonspecific nature of the symptoms and includes flu-like illness, gastroenteritis, exposure to other toxins,  and  infectious  causes  of  mental  status  changes.  Cardiovascular compromise  after  poisoning  may  represent  a  concomitant  myocardial infarction.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Remove patients from the source of exposure and address airway, breathing, and circulation.

# ■ MUSHROOMS

Mushroom poisoning occurs in four population groups: foragers who purposefully harvest mushrooms or plants for food; teenagers and young adults who use mushrooms to get 'high'; preschool-age children who accidentally  ingest  mushrooms  while  playing  outdoors;  and,  rarely,  victims  of attempted homicide or suicide.

# Clinical Features

Mushroom toxicity is divided into those with early onset, defined as within 2 hours after ingestion, and delayed onset, defined as 6 hours to 20 days after  ingestion. It  is  important  to  determine if patients ingested only one type or multiple types of mushrooms and the time elapsed from ingestion to symptoms. Foragers may be able to provide a description of the mushroom.  Clinical  features  of  common  mushroom  poisonings  are  listed  in Table 128-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Most  patients  who  develop  GI  symptoms  within  2  hours  of  ingestion have a reassuring clinical course and do not develop major organ failure (Table  128-1).  An  exception  to  this  is Amanita  smithiana ingestion, which results  in  early  GI  symptoms  and  delayed  renal  failure.  Mushrooms with potential liver, kidney, and CNS effects are often associated with onset of vomiting that is delayed for 6 or more hours after ingestion.  Toxic  species  include  species  of  genera Amanita , Galerina , Gyromitra ,  and Lepiota .  Ingestions may be misdiagnosed as viral gastrointestinal illness or food poisoning if a history of mushroom ingestion is not pursued.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Consultation  with  a  poison  center  is  advised  as  regional  differences  in mushrooms types and toxicity exist.

# ■ HYPOGLYCEMIA

Hypoglycemia  in  diabetics  is  usually  a  complication  of  treatment  with insulin or sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, glyburide, glipizide). Hypoglycemia is unlikely due to the glitizones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), glinides (repaglinide, nateglinide), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol), and rare, if  ever,  due  to  the  biguanide  metformin,  the  incretin  analogues (exenatide, liraglutide), or the amylin analogue pramlintide.

# Clinical Features

Typical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include sweating, shakiness, anxiety,  nausea,  dizziness,  palpitations,  slurred  speech,  blurred  vision, headache, seizure, focal neurologic deficits, and altered mental status ranging from confusion to coma.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is based on detecting low blood glucose during the occurrence of typical signs and symptoms which resolve with treatment. Hypoglycemia  can  easily  be  misdiagnosed  as  a  neurologic  or  psychiatric condition. The differential diagnosis includes stroke, seizure disorder, head injury,  multiple  sclerosis,  psychosis,  depression,  and  alcohol  or  drug intoxication.

CHAPTER 129: Diabetic Emergencies

703

# Clinical Features

Hyperglycemia causes an osmotic diuresis resulting in dehydration, hypotension,  and  tachycardia.  Ketonemia  causes  an  acidosis  with  myocardial depression, vasodilation, and compensatory Kussmaul respiration. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common. The absence of fever does not exclude infection. Acetone, formed from oxidation of ketone bodies, causes the characteristic fruity odor of the patient's breath.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis of DKA is based on laboratory values of glucose > 250 mg/dL, anion gap > 10 mEq/L, bicarbonate < 15 mEq/L, pH < 7.3, and a moderate ketonemia/ketonuria.  Beware  of  'euglycemic  ketoacidosis'  where  blood glucose is only mildly elevated but the other criteria are present. This may occur if  the  patient  has  just  taken  insulin,  has  impaired  gluconeogenesis (alcoholics), or takes a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, such as canaglifozin.

An anion gap metabolic acidosis results from formation of ketone bodies. In DKA, the conversion of acetoacetate to β -hydroxybutyrate is favored which  can  result  in  low  acetoacetate  levels  and  high β -hydroxybutyrate levels. If the nitroprusside test is used to detect serum or urine ketones, it may  be  falsely  low  or  negative  as  it  only  detects  acetoacetate,  not β -hydroxybutyrate.

Osmotic diuresis results in loss of sodium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus,  and  magnesium.  Serum and urine glucose and ketones are elevated. Pseudohyponatremia  is  common:  for  each  100  mg/dL  increase  in  blood glucose, the sodium decreases by 1.6 mEq/L, though some recommend this correction factor be 2.4, especially if glucose > 400 mg/dL. Serum potassium may be low from osmotic diuresis and vomiting, normal, or high from acidosis. In acidosis, potassium is driven extracellularly. Note the acidotic patient with normal or low potassium has marked depletion of total body potassium.

Laboratory  investigation  includes  serum  pH,  glucose,  electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, phosphorus, magnesium, complete blood count, urinalysis (and pregnancy if indicated), electrocardiogram, and chest radiograph  to  assess  the  severity  of  DKA  and  search  for  the  underlying cause. Determine pH using venous blood. The difference between venous and arterial pH (0.03) is not clinically significant, so the risk and pain of arterial puncture is unnecessary.

The differential diagnosis includes hypoglycemia, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic  state,  alcoholic  or  starvation  ketoacidosis,  renal  failure,  lactic acidosis, and ingestions such as salicylate, methanol, ethylene glycol, iron, or isoniazid.

# ■ HYPErOSMOLAr HYPErGLYCEMIC StAtE

Hyperosmolar  hyperglycemic  state  (HHS)  occurs  in  type  2  diabetics. Causes are similar to DKA (Table 129-2). Insulin deficiency or resistance combined  with  physiologic  stress  results  in  an  inflammatory  state  with elevated counterregulatory hormones causing hyperglycemia. The resulting osmotic diuresis causes hypovolemia and electrolyte losses.

# Clinical Features

The typical patient is elderly with type 2 diabetes and presents with nonspecific  complaints  of  weakness,  dyspnea,  chest  or  abdominal  pain,  or mental status changes, and has preexisting lung, heart, renal, or neurologic disease.

Physical examination reveals signs of dehydration with orthostasis, dry skin and mucous membranes, and altered mental status. Focal deficits and seizures may occur.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is defined by laboratory values of glucose > 600  mg/dL,  calculated  serum  osmolality  (formula:  Osm = 2  [Na + ] + glucose/18) > 315 mOsm/kg, bicarbonate > 15 mEq/L, pH > 7.3, and negative  to  mildly  positive  ketones.  Marked  elevation  in  glucose  and  serum osmolality and the absence of a significant ketosis help distinguish HHS from  DKA.  Further  laboratory  investigation  is  similar  to  that  for  DKA discussed above.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment consists of correcting the volume deficit, electrolyte imbalance, and hyperosmolality, and treating the underlying cause (Fig. 129-2). See Table 129-1 for admission guidelines.

# Alcoholic Ketoacidosis

Michael P. Kefer

Alcoholic  ketoacidosis  (AKA)  results  from  heavy  alcohol  intake,  either acute or chronic. Glycogen stores are depleted, activating lipolysis to supply energy. Lipolysis and alcohol metabolism generate ketoacids, causing an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The patient typically presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after heavy alcohol intake. The patient appears acutely ill, dehydrated, and has abdominal tenderness that is nonspecific or is the result of other causes related to alcohol, such as gastritis, hepatitis, or pancreatitis.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Laboratory investigation reveals an anion gap metabolic acidosis. However, the serum pH may vary as these patients often have mixed acid-base disorders such as a metabolic acidosis from AKA and a metabolic alkalosis from vomiting  and  dehydration.  Blood  glucose  is  low  to  mildly  elevated.  The alcohol level is usually low or undetected as symptoms limit intake. Serum ketones, acetoacetate, and its reduced form, beta-hydroxybutyrate, are elevated. If the nitroprusside test is used to measure serum and urine ketones, acetoacetate is detected, but beta-hydroxybutyrate is not. The redox state may be  such  that  most,  or  all,  acetoacetate  is  reduced  to  beta-hydroxybutyrate resulting in a falsely low- or false-negative result, respectively.

Diagnostic criteria for AKA are listed in Table 130-1. The differential diagnosis of an anion gap metabolic acidosis is listed in Table 130-2.

# ■ HYPOTHYROIDISM AND MYXEDEMA COMA

Hypothyroidism  may  be  caused  by  multiple  factors.  Myxedema  coma (also  called  myxedema  crisis)  is  a  rare,  life-threatening  expression  of hypothyroidism.  It  may  be  precipitated  by  infection,  cold  exposure, trauma, medications, or myocardial infarction. It classically occurs during the winter months in elderly women with undiagnosed or undertreated hypothyroidism.

# Clinical Features

The  presentation  of  hypothyroidism  is  summarized  in  Fig.  131-1. Patients  with  myxedema  coma  have  hypothyroidism  and  present  with metabolic and multi-organ decompensation, including hypothermia, bradycardia,  hypotension,  and  altered  mental  status.  Respiratory  insufficiency  and  altered  mental  status  can  result  from  CO 2 narcosis,  and  a difficult  airway  may  be  encountered  due  to  macroglossia,  glottic,  and oropharyngeal edema. Laboratory abnormalities include hypoglycemia and hyponatremia.

711

--- Page 732 ---

712 SECTION 13: Endocrine Emergencies

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of myxedema coma is clinical. Send confirmatory thyroid studies, but do not delay treatment for test results. Low free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (FT3), and elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are diagnostic. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, depression,  adrenal  crisis,  congestive  heart  failure,  hypoglycemia, stroke, hypothermia, meningitis, and drug overdose.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Management of myxedema coma includes:

# ■ THYROTOXICOSIS AND THYROID STORM

Hyperthyroidism refers to excess circulating hormone due to thyroid gland hyperfunction, whereas thyrotoxicosis refers to excess circulating thyroid hormone from any cause. Thyroid storm is an acute, life-threatening state of thyrotoxicosis that is most common in patients with antecedent Graves' disease.

# Clinical Features

The clinical features of thyrotoxicosis are manifestations of enhanced adrenergic activity. Signs and symptoms are shown in Table 131-1. As for thyroid storm,  the  leading  signs  and  symptoms  are  constitutional  (fever),  central nervous  system  related  (agitation,  confusion,  delirium,  stupor,  coma,  and seizure), and cardiovascular (tachycardia, arrhythmia, and heart failure).

# Diagnosis and Differential

An elevated FT4 or FT3 level and a suppressed TSH level are diagnostic of thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid storm is a clinical diagnosis. Fever and tachycardia are cardinal features; laboratory tests cannot distinguish it from thyrotoxicosis.  The  differential  diagnosis  for  thyroid  storm  includes sepsis, heat stroke, delirium tremens, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin  syndrome,  pheochromocytoma,  and  sympathomimetic  drug overdose.

--- Page 735 ---

Adrenal insufficiency results when the physiologic demand for glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids exceeds the supply from the adrenal cortex. The pituitary secretes adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and associated melanocyte  stimulating  hormone  (MSH).  ACTH  stimulates  the  adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol. Cortisol has negative feedback on the pituitary to inhibit secretion of ACTH and MSH.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to adrenal gland failure, resulting in low cortisol and aldosterone production. Clinical features include weakness, dehydration, hypotension, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes occurs  as  a  result  of  uninhibited  MSH  secretion  in  conjunction  with ACTH.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency results from inadequate secretion of ACTH  with  resultant  cortisol  deficiency.  Aldosterone  levels  are  not affected because of regulation by the renin-angiotensin axis and serum potassium  levels.  Therefore,  hyperpigmentation  and  hyperkalemia  do not occur.

Adrenal  crisis  is  the  acute,  life-threatening  form  of  adrenal  insufficiency. Clinical features described above are severe and accompanied by shock and altered mental status.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

All patients with adrenal insufficiency have low plasma cortisol levels. The ACTH level is high in primary and low in secondary adrenal insufficiency.  Cortisol  and  ACTH  levels  are  usually  not  available  in  the emergency  department,  so  the  diagnosis  of  primary  adrenal  insufficiency is based on the presence of the clinical features and lab findings of  hyponatremia,  hyperkalemia,  hypoglycemia,  anemia,  metabolic acidosis,  and  prerenal  azotemia.  Secondary  adrenal  insufficiency  is similarly diagnosed, but hyperkalemia is not seen as aldosterone secretion is normal.

The most common cause of acute adrenal insufficiency is adrenal suppression from prolonged steroid use with either abrupt steroid withdrawal or  exposure  to  increased  physiologic  stress  such  as  injury,  illness,  or surgery. It may take up to 1 year for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to recover following prolonged suppression with steroid treatment. Tables  132-1  and  132-2  list  causes  of  primary  and  secondary  adrenal insufficiency, respectively. Consider the diagnosis of adrenal crisis in any patient with unexplained hypotension refractory to pressors, especially if one of the causes listed is known to exist.

# Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

# Evaluation of Anemia and the Bleeding Patient

Rita K. Cydulka

Anemia may be chronic and unrelated to the chief complaint, or it may result from acute blood loss as seen in trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other acute hemorrhage. Suspect underlying bleeding disorders in patients presenting with spontaneous bleeding from multiple sites, bleeding from nontraumatized sites, delayed bleeding several hours after injury, or bleeding into deep tissues or joints.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The rate of the development of the anemia, the extent of the anemia, the age of the patient, and the ability of the cardiovascular system to compensate for  the  decreased oxygen-carrying capacity determine the severity of the patient's  symptoms  and  clinical  presentation.  Patients  may  complain  of weakness,  fatigue,  palpitations,  orthostatic  symptoms,  and  dyspnea  with minimal exertion. Patients may have pale conjunctiva, skin, and nail beds. Tachycardia,  hyperdynamic  precordium,  and  systolic  murmurs  may  be present. Tachypnea at rest and hypotension are late signs. Use of ethanol, prescription drugs, and recreational drugs may alter the patient's ability to compensate for the anemia.

Patients with bleeding may or may not have an obvious site of hemorrhage. A history of excessive or abnormal bleeding in the patient and other family members may indicate an underlying bleeding disorder. Historical data about liver disease and drug use, such as use of ethanol, aspirin, nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs,  warfarin,  and  antibiotics  should  be gathered. Mucocutaneous bleeding (including petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura,  and  epistaxis),  gastrointestinal,  genitourinary,  or  heavy  menstrual bleeding  are  features  associated  with  qualitative  or  quantitative  platelet disorders.  Patients  with  deficiencies  of  coagulation  factors  often  present with  delayed  bleeding,  hemarthroses,  or  bleeding  into  potential  spaces between fascial planes and into the retroperitoneum. Patients with combination abnormalities of platelets and coagulation factors, such as disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  present  with  both  mucocutaneous  and potential space bleeding.

SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

Acquired  hemolytic  anemia  may  be  autoimmune  or  drug-induced. Microangiopathic syndromes include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The classic pentad of  TTP  is  CNS  abnormalities,  renal  disease,  fever,  microangiopathic hemolytic  anemia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  HUS  consists  of  acute nephropathy or renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.  Macrovascular  hemolysis  can  be  caused  by  prosthetic heart valves.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

A decreased red blood count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are diagnostic for  anemia. The initial evaluation of newly diagnosed anemia includes a complete  blood  count,  review  of  RBC  indices,  reticulocyte  count,  stool hemoccult examination, urine pregnancy test in females, and examination of the peripheral blood smear. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count can assist in classifying the anemia and can aid in differential diagnosis (Fig. 133-1).

Laboratory  studies  used  to  diagnose  bleeding  disorders  can  be divided into the following three categories: (a) those that test the initial formation of a platelet plug (primary hemostasis); (b) those that assess the  formation  of  cross-linked  fibrin  (secondary  hemostasis);  and (c) those that test the fibrinolytic system, which is responsible for limiting  the  size  of  the  fibrin  clots  formed  (see  Tables  133-1  and  133-2). Initial studies to evaluate the patient with suspected bleeding disorders include complete blood count with platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio (INR). If there is a suspicion for a hemolytic anemia, further studies may be warranted (Table 133-3).

# Acquired Bleeding Disorders

Alisheba Hurwitz

Platelet  abnormalities,  drugs,  systemic  illnesses,  and  endogenous  anticoagulants can cause acquired bleeding disorders.

# ■ ACQUIRED PLATELET DEFECTS

# Clinical Features

Patients with platelet disorders commonly present with petechiae or mucosal bleeding. Splenomegaly may be noted in patients experiencing platelet sequestration.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Acquired platelet abnormalities include quantitative and qualitative defects. Quantitative platelet disorders may be caused by decreased platelet production (marrow infiltration, aplastic anemia, drugs, viral infections, and chronic alcohol use), or increased platelet destruction (idiopathic thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP),  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), viral infections, drugs, and HELLP syndrome). Other causes include acute hemorrhage, hemodialysis, and splenic sequestration. Qualitative platelet disorders are commonly associated with renal disease, liver disease, DIC, drugs (aspirin, NSAIDs, clopidogrel), and myeloproliferative disorders.

# ■ HEMOPHILIAS

The most common hemophilias are caused by genetic deficiencies of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B).

# Clinical Features

Bleeding complications depend on the severity of the disease. Patients with severe disease (factor VIII or factor IX activity level < 1%) experience spontaneous bleeds and difficult to control bleeding after trauma. Patients with moderate disease (1% to 5% factor activity level) may bleed spontaneously but more commonly bleed after trauma. Patients with mild disease (5% to 40% factor activity level) usually only bleed after trauma. Easy  bruising,  recurrent  hemarthrosis,  and  muscle  hematomas  are  the most  common  clinical  manifestations.  Central  nervous  system  (CNS) bleeding accounts for the most common cause of death. Retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal (GI), and soft tissue bleeding can occur. Mucocutaneous bleeding  (dental  bleeding,  epistaxis,  GI  tract  bleeding,  lungs  bleeding) can occur, although this is rare. Neck hematomas may obstruct the airway.  Unless  there  is  another  underlying  disease,  most  patients  with hemophilia do not have problems with minor cuts or abrasions. Almost all cases of hemophilia occur in men with women being genetic carriers of the disease. The unlikely exception occurs when a hemophiliac man reproduces with a woman who is a carrier of the hemophilia gene; hemophiliac females can result. Owing to spontaneous mutations and lyonization  of  the  X  chromosome  women  may  develop  varying  degrees  of decreased factor levels.

A rare form of hemophilia occurs when a person develops a spontaneous antibody to their intrinsic factor VIII. It is often (40%) associated with other conditions such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, certain drugs, the postpartum period. It usually happens in the sixth or seventh decade and affects men and women equally. Widespread purpura and internal bleeding are common with hemarthrosis less common.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Clinically, it is impossible to differentiate between hemophilias A and B. Laboratory testing in patients with hemophilia most often shows a normal prothrombin time (PT), prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and a  normal  bleeding  time.  However,  if  greater  than  30%  to  40%  of  factor activity is present, the PTT may be normal. Specific factor assays may be used to differentiate between the types of hemophilia. Ten percent to 25% of patients with hemophilia A and 1% to 2% of patients with hemophilia B will develop an inhibitor, which is an antibody against the deficient factor. The  presence  of  an  inhibitor  makes  treatment  more  difficult,  requiring

alternative, pre-activated factors such as recombinant factor VIIa or factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The mainstay of therapy is early factor replacement. Replacement factor products are listed in Table 135-1.

Factor IX required = (Target factor - Base line factor) × Weight (kg) For  severe  hemophilia,  assume  0%  intrinsic  activity.  The  half-life  of factor VIII is approximately 8 to 12 hours. For hemophilia B, the halflife of factor IX is approximately 16 to 24 hours.

# ■ VON WILLEBrAND DISEASE

# Clinical Features

von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a group of disorders caused by a defect or  deficiency  of  von  Willebrand  factor  (vWF).  vWF  is  a  cofactor  for platelet adhesion and a carrier protein for factor VIII in the plasma. Type 1 vWD is most common; patients have 20% to 50% of normal vWF levels and usually manifest with skin and mucosal bleeding symptoms. Patients with type 2 vWF have abnormal and dysfunctional vWF. Patients with type 3 vWF have complete vWF deficiency and have clinical presentations  similar  to  hemophilia.  Patients  with  mild  vWF  are  frequently unaware of the disease until bleeding occurs after a traumatic episode or surgical procedure.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The PT and PTT are usually normal. The bleeding time is prolonged and vWF activity is low. Bleeding time, however, is rarely used anymone and has  been  suplanted  by  more  specific  platelet  activation  and  aggregation studies. Variability in vWF levels can make it difficult to distinguish vWD from hemophilia A.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The treatment of vWD depends on the type of disease and the severity of bleeding. Indications for admission are similar to patients with hemophilia.

Inherited anemias stem from abnormal hemoglobin structure or production or  from  abnormal  RBC  structure  or  metabolism.  Anemia  occurs  when destruction of red blood cells exceeds production. Most patients with dyshemoglobinemia are aware of their status.

# ■ SICKLE CELL DISEASE

# Clinical Features

Most  patients  with  sickle  cell  disease  (SCD)  (homozygous  (HbSS))  or sickle trait (heterozygous (HbAS)) present with symptoms related to vasoocclusive crisis, or with pain, weakness, or infections. Physical examination  findings  commonly  include  pallor,  venous  stasis  changes,  jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac flow murmurs, cardiomegaly, and high-output congestive heart failure (CHF).

Painful  vasooclusive  crisis  in  the  musculoskeletal  system  or,  in  some cases, organ-specific symptoms are the most common presentations to the ED. Crisis occurs when sickled RBCs mechanically obstruct blood flow, causing  ischemia,  organ  damage,  and  infarction.  Crisis-causing  stresses include fever or infection (especially encapsulated organisms Haemophilus influenzae or Pneumococcus ), cold exposure or high altitude, dehydration or overexertion, medication noncompliance, or drug use.

Acute  symptomatic  anemia  results  from  splenic  sequestration,  bone marrow failure (aplastic crisis), or hemolysis due to infection and presents with fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, chronic heart failure, or shock.

Life  or  limb-threatening  events  seen  in  SCD  patients  include  acute chest  syndrome  (vasoocclusive  pulmonary  insult),  stroke,  renal  infarct, mesenteric infarcts, sepsis, avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, or priapism.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  degree  of  illness  guides  the  evaluation  of  an  acute  crisis. Although workups  should  be  individualized,  the  more  common,  vague  complaints (pain, weakness, fever) must include a search for an underlying, treatable event. See Table 136-1.

Anemia due to splenic sequestration may present as splenomegaly with or without left-upper quadrant pain and elevated reticulocyte count. Anemia due to bone marrow failure may be suggested by a depressed reticulocyte count. Leukocytosis or left shift with increased bands suggests infection. Assessment of electrolytes will allow evaluation of dehydration and renal function. Liver function tests and lipase may help evaluate abdominal pain. Perform a pregnancy test on women. Febrile SCD patients without localizing  symptoms  should  have  blood  cultures,  urinalysis,  and  chest  radiographs performed.

SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

Patients presenting with symptoms of acute chest syndrome (chest pain, cough,  fever,  dyspnea)  need  immediate  evaluation  (Table  136-2).  Chest radiographs  are  important  to  identify  the  presence  of  a  new  infiltrate. Assess oxygenation; type and cross for possible exchange transfusion.

Radiographs of the skeleton are indicated for atypical focal bone pain. Advanced imaging for abdominal pain or for neurologic manifestations will help to assess these symptoms.

737

The differential diagnosis for musculoskeletal pain includes osteomyelitis, bony infarcts, cellulitis, and acute arthritides. For abdominal pain, the differential includes pancreatitis, hepatitis, cholecystitis, pelvic inflammatory  disease,  and  pyelonephritis.  Chest  pain  may  be  due  to  acute  chest, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolus. Neurologic symptoms may be due to meningitis, cerebral infarct, ischemia, or hemorrhage.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

Initial management for acute crisis in SCD patients is primarily supportive and includes pain management and an assessment for the underlying cause of the crisis (see Tables 136-1 and 136-2).

# ■ VArIANtS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE

Other genetic variants of hemoglobinopathies exist and vary in presentation, from asymptomatic to SCD-like and depend upon the specific abnormality and whether homozygous, heterozygous, or combined with sickle cell trait.

# Thalassemias

Thalassemias are hereditary disorders caused by defective synthesis of globin chains, resulting in microcytic, hypochromic, hemolytic anemia. The  degree  of  illness  depends  upon  the  type  and  number  of  genetic abnormalities.

--- Page 758 ---

738 SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

Patients with β -thalassemia minor have mild microcytic anemia and are generally asymptomatic. Patients with β -thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia) develop hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and bony changes. They are at increased risk for infection and may develop severe anemia requiring blood transfusions. Iron overload from transfusions can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

# Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy of RBCs. This causes hemoglobin precipitation, RBC removal by the spleen, and hemolysis. The amount of hemolysis depends on degree of enzyme abnormality. Most patients are asymptomatic until an exposure  to  an  oxidative  stress  (e.g.,  medication,  infection,  fava  beans) causes  hemolysis. A  serious  complication  of  G6PD  deficiency  is  severe neonatal jaundice that presents in the first week of life. Evaluation includes a complete blood count and reticulocyte count, bilirubin levels, serum aminotransferases, and lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment is determined by the patient's overall clinical condition and includes early treatment of infection and may include blood transfusion for severe anemia.

# Hereditary Spherocytosis

Hereditary  spherocytosis  results  from  an  erythrocyte  membrane  defect creating small inflexible RBCs that are unable to pass through the spleen resulting in an increased rate of destruction and a compensatory increase in RBC production. Complications include aplastic or megaloblastic crises, cholecystitis or cholelithiasis, splenomegaly, hemolytic crisis, and neonatal hemolysis with jaundice. Treatments include blood transfusions and splenectomy in severe cases.

--- Page 759 ---

Patients are typically transfused in the emergency department to treat acute blood loss and/or circulatory shock. The goal of transfusion is to improve oxygen  delivery  to  tissues,  provide  intravascular  volume  expansion,  and replace missing or depleted clotting factors. Great care must be taken to ensure that the correct blood product is delivered to the correct patient.

# ■ WHOLE BLOOD

There are few indications for the use of whole-blood transfusion. Although whole-blood transfusion would seem ideal to replace acute blood loss, storage of whole blood inactivates platelets and other factors. Therefore, whole blood is fractionated to its components for transfusion.

# ■ PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS

Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) are prepared from whole blood by removing most platelets and/or white cells. A single unit of PRBC has 250 mL and raises an adult's hemoglobin by 1 g/dL (hematocrit by 3%). In children, 10 to 15 mL/kg of PRBCs raises the hemoglobin level by approximately 2 to 3 g/dL (hematocrit by 6% to 9%). PRBCs increase oxygen-carrying capacity in anemic patients.

The decision to transfuse PRBC is based on individual clinical judgment, taking into account patient's hemodynamic status, underlying medical condition, tolerance for anemia, and risk of end-organ ischemic injury. Adequate oxygen delivery in healthy normovolemic patients can be maintained  with  hemoglobin  levels  as  low  as  7  g/dL,  although  patients  with comorbid conditions may require transfusion at higher levels of hemoglobin. The usual indications for PRBC transfusion include (a) acute blood loss about 30% of blood volume (1500 mL in adult), (b) acute hemorrhage, (c) unstable trauma patients based on inadequate response to an initial 2-L bolus  of  IV  crystalloid  or  40  mL/kg  in  children;  and  (d)  symptomatic anemia with hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or being at-risk for ischemic events, such as  patients  with  hemoglobin < 8  to  9  g/dL  who  have  sepsis  or  ischemic heart or brain injury.

Type  and  cross-match  assesses ABO/Rh  blood  type,  the  presence  of antibodies, and patient and donor blood compatibility. Blood type can be determined  in  approximately  15  minutes,  whereas  it  takes  about  45  to 60 minutes to perform a serologic cross-match.

In critical situations, where there is no time to perform a complete ABO/ Rh-typing, group O/Rh-negative blood ('universal donor') can be given to patients without waiting for a complete type and cross-match. Type O/Rhpositive blood may be used if Rh-negative blood is unavailable, but should be avoided in girls and women of childbearing potential. Before transfusion, blood for baseline laboratory tests, type, and crossmatching should be obtained.

739

--- Page 760 ---

740 SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

Packed red blood cells may be further treated to minimize complications  in  special  patient  populations,  such  as  neonates,  transplant  and patients on transplant list, patients who have received prior transfusions, pregnant  patients,  immunocompromised  patients,  and  patients  with hypersensitivity  to  plasma.  Options  include  leukocyte-reduced,  irradiated,  frozen  deglycerolized,  washed,  and Cytomegalovirusnegative PRBCs.

One unit of PRBC is generally transfused over 1 to 2 hours. PRBCs should be transfused more rapidly in patients with hemodynamic instability.  Single-unit  PRBC transfusions should not exceed 4 hours to prevent contamination. Micropore filters are used to filter out microaggregates of platelets, fibrin, and leukocytes. Normal saline solution is the only crystalloid compatible with PRBCs. Blood warmers or concurrently administered warmed saline solution (39°C to 43°C or 102.2°F to 109.4°F) can be used to prevent hypothermia.

# ■ MASSIVE tRANSFUSION

Massive transfusion is  the  replacement  of  one  blood  volume or approximately 10 units of PRBCs in an adult within a 24-hour period. The best ratio of PRBCs to platelets to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during a massive transfusion is controversial. Some experts advocate a 1:1:1 ratio, although lower ratios of platelets to FFP have been used without clear evidence of inferiority.  Complications  of  massive  transfusion  include  coagulopathy, citrate  toxicity,  hypocalcemia,  hypomagnes,  emia,  and  hypothermia.  See Table 137-1 for recognition, management, and evaluation of selected acute transfusion reactions.

# ■ PLAtELEtS

Platelet transfusions may be used in thrombocytopenic patients to prevent bleeding or to help stop active bleeding. Platelet transfusion is usually not helpful in cases of bleeding from platelet dysfunction (e.g., uremia) or from thrombocytopenia  due  to  increased  consumption/sequestration  until  the underlying disorder (e.g., DIC) is corrected. General indications for platelet transfusion include platelet count < 5,000/mm 3 in asymptomatic patients, platelet count < 20,000/mm 3 with a coagulation disorder, low-risk procedure, during outpatient treatment, platelet count < 50,000/mm 3 with active bleeding or invasive procedure within 4 hours, platelet count < 100,000/mm 3 with  neurologic  or  cardiac  surgery,  or  as  part  of  a  massive  transfusion protocol.

One apheresis single-donor platelet unit will increase the platelet count by up to 50,000/mm 3 . Typical dose is 1 unit or 5 mL/kg. Typical dose of pooled donor platelet is 6 units or 5 mL/kg.

ABO-type  specific  platelets  are  preferable.  Platelets  may  also  be washed  or  irradiated.  The  platelet  count  should  be  checked  at  1  and 24 hours after transfusion. Transfused platelets survive 3 to 5 days unless there is a platelet- consumptive process.

742 SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

# ■ FRESH FROZEN PLASMA

Fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors and fibrinogen. FFP is used  for  replacement  of  multiple  coagulation  deficiencies  (liver  failure, warfarin-induced over-anticoagulation and massive transfusion) and to correct coagulation defects for which no factor is available. FFP is also administered  prior  to  high-risk  invasive  procedures  if  PT/INR > 1.5X  normal, aPTT > 1.5X  top  of  normal  range,  or  coagulation  factor  assay < 25% normal activity. FFP is not indicated to treat a prolonged INR in the absence of active bleeding.

Fresh frozen plasma needs to be thawed for 20 to 40 minutes before it can be used. Each 200 to 250 mL pack of FFP contains 1 unit/mL of each coagulation  factor  and  2  mL  fibrinogen.  In  general,  1  unit  of  FFP  will increase most coagulation factors by 3% to 5% in a 70-kg adult. FFP should be ABO-type compatible. Type AB is the universal donor for FFP, and in emergencies,  universal  donor  FFP  can  be  given  minutes  after  thawing. Starting dose is 15 mL/kg (or 4 units in a 70-kg adult). If rapid reversal of a vitamin K antagonist coagulopathy is needed, prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant activated factor VII is faster and more reliable.

# ■ CRYOPRECIPItAtE

Cryoprecipitate is derived from FFP. One bag of cryoprecipitate contains 80 units factor VIII, 200 to 300 mL von Willebrand factor, 40 to 60 units fibrinogen, factor XIII, and variable amounts of fibronectin.

Cryoprecipitate is indicated for (a) active bleeding in patients with afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen levels < 100 mL/dL) as a result of a pathological process (DIC, severe liver disease, abruptio placentae,  amniotic  fluid  embolus,  massive  transfusion);  (b)  active  bleeding  in patients with von Willebrand disease when desmopressin (DDAVP) is not effective or in patients with von Willebrand disease type 2B, or if factor VIII  concentrate  containing  von  Willebrand  factor  is  not  available;  and (c) hemophilia type A when virally inactivated factor VIII concentrates are not available. Cryoprecipitate can also be used as fibrin surgical adhesives in surgical patients.

Cryoprecipitate should be ABO-compatible. The volume of each unit is 20 to 50 mL. The usual dose is 1 unit/5 kg of body weight (10 to 14 units for an adult) and will raise fibrinogen concentration to 75 mL/dL.

# ■ FIBRINOGEN CONCENtRAtE

Fibrinogen concentrate is derived from pooled human plasma. It used to treat bleeding episodes in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency.

Fibrinogen is dosed according to the patient's fibrinogen baseline level, the target level (usually > 150 mL/dL), volume of distribution, and body weight. If the baseline level is unknown, the initial dose is fibrinogen concentrate 70 mL/kg.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is a blood-derived concentration of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X). Some PCC formulations may also contain the anticoagulant proteins C, S, and antitrombin, as well as heparin. PCC administration does not necessitate ABO-compatibility testing.

# Anticoagulants, Antiplatelet Agents, and Fibrinolytics

Jessica L. Smith

Antithrombotic therapy is used to treat acute coronary syndrome, deep venous  thrombosis  (DVT),  pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  transient  ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke. These agents are also used to prevent occlusive vascular events in patients at risk. Detailed management strategies and dosing regimens are provided in Chapter 18, 'Acute Coronary Syndromes:  Management  of  Myocardial  Infarction  and  Unstable Angina,'  Chapter  25,  'Thromboembolism,'  and  Chapter  141,  'Stroke and Transient  Ischemic Attack.' This  chapter  provides  an  overview  of antithrombotic agents.

# ■ ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS

The goals of anticoagulant therapy include (1) stop further acute thrombosis, (2) reduce the risk of embolism from a thrombus, and (3) prevent the formation of de novo thrombus in patients at risk.

Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant in the United States.  It  preferentially  inhibits  vitamin  K-dependent  cofactors  in  the extrinsic coagulation cascade. Dosing is guided by measuring the international normalized ratio (INR), and most patients are therapeutic in a range of 2 to 3. Patients with mechanical heart valves or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome require an INR of 2.5 to 3.5. It takes about 3 to 4 days to reach full anticoagulation upon initiating treatment. A parenteral anticoagulant should be used until the INR is maintained in the desired range for 2 days, as warfarin therapy causes a transient state of thrombogenesis for 24  to  36  hours  at  the  start  of  therapy.  Parenteral  bridging  is  crucial  in patients with prosthetic heart valves or those who are at high risk for catastrophic complications of intravascular thrombosis when initiating warfarin. Warfarin use is contraindicated during pregnancy due to teratogenicity. Complications  of  warfarin  use  include  skin  necrosis  (associated  with protein C deficiency) and increased bleeding risk in patients with hypertension,  anemia,  prior  cerebrovascular  disease,  gastrointestinal  (GI) lesions, or renal disease. A number of medications, foods, or disease states interfere with warfarin absorption or metabolism and cause clinically significant  consequences.  There  are  three  approaches  for  warfarin  reversal depending on the intensity of therapy and the patient's risk for recurrent thromboembolism: stop the warfarin, administer vitamin K, and replace deficient coagulation factors. Figure 138-1 describes the management of warfarin-induced coagulopathy.

Direct  thrombin  inhibitors  like  dabigatran,  and  factor  Xa  inhibitors like rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are used in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation to reduce systemic embolism and stroke risk. A normal thrombin  clotting  time  excludes  significant  coagulopathy  due  to  dabigatran. Idarucizumab, 5 g IV ,  can  be  used  for  dabigatran  reversal.  It  may  be repeated once, if needed No other reversal agent is currently available.

Figure 138-1. Management of prolonged INR (warfarin-induced coagulopathy). * High risk of bleeding: age > 75 years, concurrent antiplatelet drug use, polypharmacy, liver  or  renal  disease,  alcoholism,  recent  surgery,  or  trauma. † There are no validated tools to predict risk of short-term major bleeding in patients with severe over-anticoagulation.  The  decision  to  admit  for  observation  relies  on  physician judgment. FFP = fresh frozen plasma; IU = international unit; PCC = prothrombin complex concentrate; rFVIIa = recombinant activated factor VII.

Hemodialysis can remove 60% or more of dabigatran, but hemodialysis is not effective in removing rivaroxaban. If emergency reversal is needed for dabigatran or rivaroxaban, activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant activated factor VII can be used. Fresh frozen plasma can

also  be  used  to  reverse  rivaroxaban,  but  has  not  been  shown  to  have  a major benefit in dabigatran reversal.

# ■ hepARINS, pOLYSACChARIDeS, AND hIRUDINS

Parenteral  agents  include  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH),  low-molecularweight  heparin  (LMWH)  (e.g.,  enoxaparin,  dalteparin),  Xa  inhibitors (fondaparinux),  and  direct  thrombin  inhibitors  (e.g.,  hirudin,  lepirudin, bivalirudin,  argatroban).  UFH  and  LMWH  are  used  to  treat  and  prevent DVT, as well as PE, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. Dosing regimens for UFH and LMWH are weight based. UFH requires monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time. Therapeutic range is 1.5 to 2.5 'normal' value. Heparin and LMWH may be used during pregnancy. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours may be used in outpatient management of DVT. The two major complications of heparin are bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Hirudin, lepirudin, and argatroban can be used for anticoagulation in patients with HIT.

Although protamine can reverse the anticoagulation effects of heparin, the  adverse  effects  of  protamine  are  significant.  LMWH  carries  a  lower bleeding risk than UFH, but a higher bleeding risk in patients with renal disease. LMWH may also cause pruritis, local skin reaction, or rarely, skin necrosis.

# ■ ANTIpLATeLeT AGeNTS

Oral agents include aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, dipyridamole, and cilostazol. Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor; its effects last for the life of the platelet. Nonenteric-coated aspirin (162 to 325 mg) should be administered in the setting of ACS, although it is contraindicated during active GI hemorrhage, it is generally considered safe to give to closely monitored patients with guaiac positive stool. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories have the potential to reduce the efficacy of aspirin. Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor inhibit platelet activation by rendering the fibrinogen receptor ineffective. An oral loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg results in full antiplatelet effect by 2 hours, and sustained effects last up to 48 hours. Side effects of aspirin are mainly GI and dose related. Complications  of  clopidogrel  include  dyspepsia,  rash,  or  diarrhea.  Omeprazole reduces clopidogrel's efficacy.

GPIIb/IIIa  parenteral  medications  alter  the  common  final  pathway receptor in platelet aggregation. These agents should be used in consultation  with  the  interventional  cardiologist.  Patients  receiving  GPIIb/IIIa agents are at increased risk of bleeding complications during cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass surgery, but are not at increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

# ■ FIBRINOLYTICS

Fibrinolytic  agents  include  streptokinase,  anistreplase,  alteplase/tPA, reteplase,  and  tenecteplase.  Although  mechanisms  of  action  vary,  each agent eventually converts plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down the

fibrin in a thrombus. Alteplase/tPA theoretically causes less systemic fibrinolysis, without the antigenic side effects of streptokinase and anistreplase that  prevent  retreatment  within  6  months  and  preclude  treatment  within 12  months  of  a  streptococcal  infection.  Strict  adherence  to  established guidelines and informed consent is essential. Hemorrhagic complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, may occur. Streptokinase and anistreplase may cause hypotension or anaphylaxis. Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy are listed in Table 138-1.

Protamine is given slowly IV over 1-3 min with a maxi- mum of 50 mg over any 10-min period. Protamine has an anaphylaxis risk. Protamine does not completely reverse low-molecular- weight heparin. Enoxaparin: Protamine 1 mg IV (maximum dose, 50 mg) for every 1 mg of enoxaparin given in the previous 8 h. If 8-12 h since last enoxaparin dose, give protamine 0.5 mg IV for every 1 mg of enoxaparin given. Dalteparin and tinzaparin: Protamine 1 mg IV per every 100 units of dalteparin or tinzaparin given.

Oncologic emergencies arise from the underlying malignancy or as complications of therapy.

# ■ AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION

Patients with tumors of the upper and lower respiratory tract may experience acute airway compromise due to edema, bleeding, infection, or loss of protective mechanisms. Presenting symptoms and signs include dyspnea, tachypnea, wheezing, and stridor. Imaging involves plain radiographs, CT scan,  and/or  endoscopic  visualization.  Emergency  measures  include humidified oxygen, optimal patient positioning, and possibly administration of a helium-oxygen mixture. If intubation is required, an 'awake look' with  a  fiber  optic  bronchoscope  with  a  5-0  or  6-0  endotracheal  tube  is preferred. A  surgical  airway  such  as  cricothyroidotomy,  transtracheal  jet ventilation, or tracheotomy may be needed.

# ■ BONE METASTASES AND PATHOLOGIC FRACTURES

Patient with solid tumors, most commonly in breast, lung, and prostate, may present with bony metastases and pathologic fractures, usually in the axial skeleton and proximal limbs. Plain radiographs may only identify half of metastases, so negative films should be followed by CT with contrast or MRI. Control pain with opioid analgesia. Most pathologic fractures  require  surgical  intervention.  Painful  bone  metastases  are  treated with radiotherapy.

# ■ SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION

Spinal cord compression from metastases to the vertebral bodies may cause weakness,  radicular  pain,  and  bowel  or  bladder  dysfunction.  MRI  is  the imaging study of choice. The presentation, evaluation, and management of malignant spinal cord compromise are described in Table 139-1.

Consider giving corticosteroids if imaging will be delayed. Malignant spinal cord compression is a radiotherapy emergency.

# ■ MALIGNANT PERICARDIAL EFFUSION

Malignant pericardial effusions are usually asymptomatic but can progress  to  life-threatening  cardiac  tamponade.  Symptoms  depend  on  the rate of accumulation (see Chapter 24, 'The Cardiomyopathies, Myocarditis,  and  Pericardial  Disease').  Patients  with  symptomatic  effusions may present with chest heaviness, dyspnea, cough, and syncope. Physical examination findings include tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, hypotension,  distended  neck  veins,  muffled  heart  tones,  and  pulsus paradoxus.

--- [TABLE DETECTED] ---
TablE 139-1 | Malignant Spinal Cord Compression
Suspect | Most common cancers: lung, breast, prostate. Thoracic location: 70%. Progressive pain and worse when supine. Motor weakness: proximal legs. Sensory changes and bladder or bowel dysfunction: late findings.
Imaging | MRI: modality of choice, image entire vertebral column. Plain radiographs: may detect vertebral body metastases but less sensitive and specific for malignant spinal cord compression. CT myelography: used when MRI is not available.
Corticosteroids | Dexamethasone, 10 mg IV followed by 4 mg PO or IV every 6 h. Consider starting in ED if imaging is delayed.
Radiotherapy | Beneficial in approximately 70% of cases. Prognosis highly dependent on pretreatment neurologic function.
Surgery | Consider in highly selected cases, such as: Patient in good general condition and able to undergo extensive surgery Appropriate prognostic life expectancy Rapidly progressive symptoms Clinical worsening during radiotherapy Unstable vertebral column
--- [END OF TABLE] ---

Echocardiography is the test of choice as it can demonstrate the presence of tamponade. Chest radiograph may demonstrate an enlarged cardiac silhouette or pleural effusion. ECG may show sinus tachycardia, low  QRS  amplitude,  or  electrical  alternans.  The  differential  diagnosis includes  cardiomyopathy  related  to  chemotherapy,  such  as  doxorubin and  radiation  therapy. Asymptomatic  effusions  do  not  require  specific treatment.  Symptomatic  effusions  are  treated  with  ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis.

# ■ SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME

Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome most commonly occurs due to external compression of the superior vena cava by an external malignant mass such as lung cancer or lymphoma. It is less commonly caused by intravascular thrombosis. The most common symptoms are face or arm swelling, distended neck veins, dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. CT of the chest with IV contrast is the diagnostic procedure of choice. CXR will usually show a mediastinal mass.

Patients with neurologic symptoms require urgent treatment including  supplemental  oxygen  and  elevation  of  the  head  and  upper  body. Dexamethasone 20  mg  IV  or methylprednisolone 125  to  250  mg  IV may  be  beneficial  in  patients  with  increased  intracranial  pressure  or lymphoma.  In  patients  without  neurologic  symptoms,  SVC  syndrome usually  does  not  cause  rapid  deterioration  and  can  await  consultation regarding  chemotherapy,  radiation,  or  intravascular  stenting.  Patients with intravascular thrombosis may require anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, or catheter removal.

CHAPTER 139: Emergency Complications of Malignancy

753

# ■ HYPERCALCEMIA OF MALIGNANCY

Hypercalcemia is most commonly seen with breast cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma. The symptoms are nonspecific and include polydipsia, polyuria,  generalized  weakness,  lethargy,  anorexia,  nausea,  constipation, abdominal pain, volume depletion, and altered mentation.

Signs and symptoms are related to the rate of rise and may occur above 12 mg/dL (ionized > 5.5 mg/dL). ECG may show shortened QT interval, ST depression, and atrioventricular blocks.

Normal saline infusion to restore normovolemia followed by an infusion of 250 mL/h if the patient can tolerate is the mainstay of treatment. Furosemide is not recommended unless needed to prevent volume overload in patients with cardiac or renal failure. Further treatment should be discussed with the patient's oncologist. Bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid 4 mg IV over 15 minutes or pamidronate 60 to 90 mg IV over 4 to 24 hours can prevent bone resorption. Calcitonin 4 IU/kg SC or IM causes a more rapid decrease in calcium levels. Glucocorticoids may be helpful in lymphoma  and  multiple  myeloma.  Consider  hemodialysis  for  patients  with profound mental status changes and renal failure, or those who cannot tolerate  a  normal  saline  infusion  (see  Chapter  4,  'Fluids,  Electrolytes,  and Acid Base Disorders').

# ■ HYPONATREMIA DUE TO SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE ANTI-DIURETIC HORMONE (SIADH)

Inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion is most commonly associated with bronchogenic lung cancer, but can also occur from chemotherapy or medications. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, headache, altered mentation,  and  seizures.  Mild  hyponatremia  ( > 125  mEq/L)  is  usually asymptomatic.

SIADH should be suspected in patients with cancer who present with normovolemic  hyponatremia.  Laboratory  abnormalities  include  serum osmolality < 280  mOsm/L,  urine  osmolality > 100  mOsm/L,  and  urine sodium > 20 mEq/L. The differential diagnosis includes hypothyroidism, renal failure, cirrhosis, adrenal crisis, and hypovolemia/hypervolemia.

Mild hyponatremia > 125 mEq/L is treated with a water restriction of 500 mL/d and close follow-up. More severe hyponatremia is treated with furosemide 0.5 to 1 mg/kg PO with normal saline infusion to maintain normovolemia. Three percent hypertonic saline is reserved for severe hyponatremia < 120 mEq/L with seizures or coma. An infusion of 25 to 100 mL/h should be titrated to a correction of 0.5 to 1 mEq/h with a maximum of 12 mEq/L/d (see Chapter 4, 'Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid Base Disorders').

# ■ ADRENAL CRISIS

Adrenal crisis is most commonly caused by acute physiologic stress in the face of exogenous steroid-induced adrenal suppression or malignant infiltration of adrenal tissue. Symptoms include weakness or nausea, and hypotension  unresponsive  to  fluids.  Laboratory  abnormalities  may  include hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. A serum cortisol level is ideally  drawn  before  giving  steroids.  Treat  acute  adrenal  insufficiency

--- Page 774 ---

754

SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

empirically with stress-dose hydrocortisone 100  to  150  mg  IV , methylprednisolone 20 to 30 mg IV, or dexamethasone 4 mg IV, IV crystalloids, and supportive care (see Chapter 132, 'Adrenal Insufficiency and Adrenal Crisis').

# ■ TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME

Tumor lysis syndrome occurs when massive quantities of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid are released. It usually occurs 1 to 3 days after chemotherapy  for  acute  leukemia  or  lymphoma.  The  resulting  hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia may cause uric acid precipitates  and  calcium  phosphate  deposits  in  the  kidney  with  renal failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, tetany, and seizures. Laboratory evaluation should include 12-lead ECG, basic electrolyte levels, complete blood count, uric acid, and phosphorus.

Preventative  measures reduce the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperkalemia is the most immediate life threat. Treatment of hyperkalemia is  with insulin,  glucose,  bicarbonate (if  acidotic),  and albuterol (see Chapter 4, 'Fluids, Electrolytes, and Acid Base Disorders'). Avoid calcium unless ventricular arrhythmias or widened QRS complexes are seen, as it may  worsen  calcium  phosphate  precipitation  in  the  kidney.  Aggressive infusion of isotonic fluids reverses volume depletion and helps to prevent renal  deposition  of  uric  acid  and  calcium  phosphate  crystals.  Manage hyperphosphatemia with IV insulin and glucose . Phosphate binders have a limited  effect.  Consider  hemodialysis  for  potassium  levels  above  6.0 mEq/L, uric acid levels above 10.0 mg/dL, phosphate levels above 10 mg/ dL, creatinine levels above 10 mg/dL, symptomatic hypocalcemia, or volume overload. Patients with tumor lysis syndrome should be admitted to an intensive care unit.

# ■ FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA

Febrile neutropenia is defined by temperatures above 38°C for an hour or a single temperature above 38.3°C with an absolute neutrophil count below 1000 cells/mm 3 . Neutrophil counts typically reach a nadir 10 to 15 days after chemotherapy and rebound 5 days later.

Febrile neutropenic patients often lack localizing signs and symptoms because of an attenuated immune response. Meticulous attention must be paid to all skin surfaces, mucosal areas, and vascular access sites in which the patient may have an occult infection. Digital rectal examination is often withheld until after initial antibiotic administration because of the fear of inducing bacteremia.

Laboratory evaluation includes complete blood count with differential, blood cultures obtained through all lumens of indwelling catheters as well as a peripheral site, urinalysis, urine culture, and CXR, electrolytes, renal, and liver function tests. Additional studies based on symptoms may include stool  culture  (diarrhea),  sputum  culture  (cough),  lumbar  puncture  (headache, stiff neck, altered mental status), wound culture (drainage), and CT or ultrasound (abdominal pain).

The decision for empiric antibiotics and admission should be made with the  patient's  oncologist.  Empiric  antibiotics  (Table  139-2)  are  generally

TablE 139-2 | Initial Empiric Antibiotic Therapy in | Febrile Neutropenia
Circumstance | Drug and Adult Dosage | Comments
Outpatient | Ciprofloxacin, 500 mg PO every 8 h and Amoxicillin/clavulanate, 500 mg PO every 8 h | Useful for low-risk patients with daily assessments by a medical provider for the initial 3 days.
Monotherapy | Cefepime, 2 g IV every 8 h or Ceftazidime, 2 g IV every 8 h or Imipenem/cilastatin, 1 g IV every 8 h or Meropenem, 1 g IV every 8 h or Piperacillin/tazobactam, 4.5 g IV every 6 h | Monotherapy with these broad- spectrum agents appears to be as good as dual-drug therapy in most circumstances.
Dual therapy | One of the monotherapy agents plus Gentamicin, 1.7 mg/kg IV every 8 h or Tobramycin, 1.7 mg/kg IV every 8 h or Amikacin, 5 mg/kg IV every 8 h | Potential advances include syner- gistic effects against some gram- negative bacteria and reduced emergence of drug resistance. There is an increased risk for adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and hypokalemia.
Risk factors for severe gram-positive infection (see text) | Vancomycin, 1 g IV every 12 h plus Cefepime, 2 g IV every 8 h or Ceftazidime, 2 g IV every 8 h or Imipenem/cilastatin, 1 g IV every 8 h or Meropenem, 1 g IV every 8 h | Vancomycin is not usually necessary for initial empiric antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin may be incorporated into initial therapeutic regimens of high-risk patients in institutions with increased gram-positive infection rates.
--- [END OF TABLE] ---

indicated for an ANC < 500/mm 3 . For neutrophil counts between 500 and 1000, the decision is based on the patient's presentation. Add vancomycin for severe mucositis, catheter site infection, recent use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis,  hypotension,  residence  in  an  institution  with  hospitalassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or known colonization with resistant gram-positive organisms.

# ■ HYPERVISCOSITY SYNDROME

Hyperviscosity syndrome refers to impaired blood flow due to abnormal elevations of paraproteins or blood cells. It is most common in patients with dysproteinemia (e.g., Waldenstrom's macroglobulimenia and multiple  myeloma),  acute  leukemia,  or  polycythemia.  Hematocrits  above 60%  and  WBC  counts  above  100,000/mm 3   may  cause  hyperviscosity syndromes.

Initial  symptoms  include  fatigue,  abdominal  pain,  headache,  blurry vision, dyspnea, fever, or altered mental status. Thrombosis or bleeding may  occur.  Physical  exam  findings  may  include  retinal  hemorrhages,

--- Page 776 ---

756

SECTION 14: Hematologic and Oncologic Emergencies

exudates, and 'sausage-linked' vessels. Elevated serum viscosity ( > 4) or rouleaux formation (red cells stacked like coins) support the diagnosis. Serum viscosity measurement will not identify hyperviscosity caused by polycythemia or leukemia.

Initial therapy consists of intravenous isotonic fluids and plasmapheresis or leukopheresis in consultation with a hematologist. A temporizing measure in patients with coma is 1000 mL phlebotomy with simultaneous infusion of 2 to 3 L normal saline.

# ■ THROMBOEMBOLISM

Thromboembolism is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. See Chapter 25 for discussion of the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is  the  recommended  initial  treatment  for  cancer  patients  with venous thromboembolism and is usually continued for the duration of treatment for the clot. There is insufficient experience with the new oral anticoagulants to recommend them.

# ■ NAUSEA AND VOMITING

Chemotherapy  commonly  causes  nausea  and  vomiting.  Other  causes  of nausea and vomiting include radiation enteritis, bowel obstruction, infection  or  tumor  infiltration,  and  increased  intracranial  pressure.  Treatment consists  of  rehydration,  administration  of  antiemetics,  and  correction  of electrolyte derangements (Table 139-3).

# ■ EXTRAVASATION OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS

Clinical manifestations of extravasation include pain, erythema, and swelling, usually within hours of the infusion. Consult with the patient's oncologist to discuss the use of antidotes for extravasation of anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, mitomycin, cisplatin, mechlorethamine, and paclitaxel.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Identify  patients  with  high-risk  features,  such  as  patients  older  than 50 years with a new or worsening headache. Sudden onset of a maximum intensity headache, often described as a 'thunderclap headache,' is  associated  10%  to  14%  of  the  time  with  a  high-risk  etiology  (see Table 140-2).

Assess headache quality, pattern, frequency, intensity, location, and any associated symptoms such as fever or visual changes. Additional information such as medication history, potential toxic exposures, prior headache history, substance abuse, comorbid conditions, or family history of headaches may be useful.

Tailor  the  physical  examination  based  on  patient  history  to  identify potential causes of headache. Specific physical examination findings may help to focus potential diagnoses, such as the presence of fever, hypertension, sinus or temporal artery tenderness, papilledema or elevated intraocular pressure, neck stiffness, or neurologic abnormalities.

While laboratory testing is often of limited value in the workup of an acute  headache,  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  and/or  C-reactive protein (CRP) are useful when temporal arteritis is suspected. When indicated, a noncontrast head CT scan can be useful to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, space-occupying lesion, signs of potentially  elevated  intracranial  pressure,  or  subarachnoid  hemorrhage. Additional diagnostic studies may be indicated when the head CT is negative, for example, if clinical suspicion remains for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Depending on clinical suspicion, other imaging modalities may be useful, such  as  MRI  to  assess  for  cerebral  venous  thrombosis,  and  MR  or  CT angiography to evaluate for arterial dissection or small subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lumbar puncture can be utilized when meningitis or encephalitis is suspected (see Chapter 148, 'Central Nervous System and Spinal Infections') or to look for evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage after a negative  CT  scan  (see  Chapter  141,  'Stroke  Syndromes  and  Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage').

Consider subdural hematoma or intracerebral hemorrhage as potential sources of headache in elderly patients, alcoholics, substance abusers, and in patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications. Consider

cerebellar hemorrhage when headache is associated with vestibular symptoms as this may need surgical consultation.

Headaches associated with brain tumors may be bilateral, unilateral, constant,  or  intermittent.  These  are  classically  described  as  worse  upon awakening,  worsened  by  Valsalva  maneuver,  positional,  and  associated with nausea and vomiting. Consider the possibility of primary or metastatic brain lesions in patients with known cancer diagnoses, seizures, or mental status changes.

Risk  factors  for cerebral  venous  thrombosis include  patients  with hypercoagulable states due to oral contraceptive use, postpartum or perioperative  status,  clotting  factor  deficiencies,  or  polycythemia.  Papilledema may  be  present,  and  neurological  findings  can  wax  and  wane.  Lumbar puncture may demonstrate an increased opening pressure, and MR venography is most useful for diagnosis.

Temporal  arteritis (see  Table  140-3)  presents  most  commonly  in patients over the age of 50 and its incidence increases with age. Associated symptoms may include fatigue, fever, jaw claudication, and vision changes. The involved temporal artery may be tender, nonpulsatile, or have a diminished pulse, but can also be normal. ESR and CRP can be helpful in establishing  the  diagnosis,  and  a  temporal  artery  biopsy  allows  a  definitive diagnosis.

Migraine headaches are the most common benign cause of headache in ED patients. These generally have a gradual onset, last 4 to 72 hours, and are typically unilateral, pulsating, and worsened by physical activity. Nausea  and  vomiting,  photophobia,  and  phonophobia  are  frequently  present, and the headache may be associated with or without an aura.

Idiopathic  intracranial  hypertension ,  also  known  as  pseudotumor cerebri, is most common in obese women ages 20 to 44. This may present with  headaches,  transient  vision  disturbances,  back  pain,  and  pulsatile tinnitus,  and  when  left  untreated  can  lead  to  permanent  vision  loss. The diagnosis  is  most  often  made  by  the  presence  of  papilledema,  a  normal neurological examination, and elevated lumbar puncture opening pressure.

Intracranial hypotension can occur after a procedure that violates the dura  such  as  lumbar  puncture  or  epidural  anesthesia.  This  headache  is typically  worsened  with  upright  posture  and  improved  with  lying  down. Alterations in hearing or vision, nausea, and vomiting may occur.

# Stroke Syndromes and Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

Steven Go

Stroke encompasses any disease process that interrupts normal blood flow to the brain. Ischemic strokes (87%) are more common than intracerebral hemorrhage (10%) or nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (3%) (Table 141-1). A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by ischemia but without an acute infarction of brain tissue. TIA episodes typically lasts less than 1 to 2 hours, but duration of symptoms alone can be unreliable in discriminating between TIA and stroke as they are similar disease processes on a continuum of severity.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Specific findings in patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke depend on the regions of the brain that are compromised and the severity of the insult (Table 141-2).

Typical symptoms of anterior cerebral artery involvement include contralateral  leg  weakness  and  sensory  changes.  A  middle  cerebral  artery stroke presents with contralateral hemiparesis (arm > leg),  facial  plegia, and sensory loss. Aphasia is often present if the dominant hemisphere (usually left) is affected. Inattention, neglect, and dysarthria without aphasia are all signs of nondominant hemisphere involvement.

A posterior circulation stroke can present with subtle clinical findings. Unilateral limb weakness, dizziness, vertigo, blurry vision, headache, dysarthria, visual field loss, gait ataxia, cranial nerve VII dysfunction, lethargy, and sensory deficits can occur alone or in various combinations. Basilar artery occlusion can produce these symptoms, as well as oculomotor signs, Horner's syndrome, and rarely, a 'locked-in' state. Cerebellar strokes present  similarly  to  other  posterior  stroke  syndromes,  but  these  patients  can deteriorate rapidly if a hematoma or edema is present.

Cervical  artery  dissection  can  involve  either  the  anterior  or  posterior arterial systems and symptoms reflect the area of compromised brain tissue. A patient with an internal carotid  dissection  may  present  with  unilateral head pain (68%), neck pain (39%), or face pain (10%). Vertebral artery dissections may present with neck pain (66%) and headache (65%), which can be unilateral or bilateral.

Intracranial hemorrhages may be clinically indistinguishable from cerebral  infarction  on  physical  examination  and  patients  may  present  with similar neurological deficits. SAH is classically described as a sudden onset of  headache  at  its  maximal  intensity  ('thunderclap'  headache),  although patients with severe headaches and significant changes in intensity or quality from previous experiences may prompt consideration for this or other intracranial abnormalities in appropriate clinical circumstances. Approximately 20% of patients who presented with SAH had onset of symptoms

associated with activities known to elevate blood pressure, such as sexual intercourse, weight lifting, defecation, or coughing. Loss of consciousness, seizure, diplopia, vomiting, photophobia, nuchal irritation, low-grade fever, and altered mental status all may occur. The presence or absence of focal neurological findings depends on the location of the aneurysm.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Patients with stroke may present variably and sometimes subtly. Assess for stroke risk factors based on age and comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, coronary atherosclerosis, valvular replacement,  and  recent  myocardial  infarction.  Risk  factors  for  SAH  include excessive alcohol consumption, polycystic kidney disease, family history of SAH, Marfan's syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Inquire about a history of drug use, chiropractic manipulation, or recent activities associated with blood-pressure elevation. Consider alternative diagnoses that may mimic  stroke  (Table  141-3).  If  ischemic  stroke  is  the  primary  working diagnosis and thrombolytic therapy is being considered, it is essential to obtain an accurate determination of the time the patient was last known to be at their neurological baseline and whether the patient may be a candidate for thrombolytic therapy (Tables 141-4 and 141-5).

Focus patient assessment on the neurological examination, with particular emphasis on detecting motor weakness, sensory deficits, and cerebellar dysfunction. Depending on clinical circumstances, investigate other findings such as meningismus, carotid bruits, signs of embolic disease, papilledema, or preretinal hemorrhage. Calculate a National Institutes of Health Stroke  Scale  (NIHSS)  score  if  thrombolytic  therapy  may  be  considered. Appropriately expedite the history, physical examination, laboratory, and radiographic imaging.

An emergent noncontrasted CT scan of the brain (best interpreted by a neuroradiologist) is essential to determine whether hemorrhage or a stroke mimic is present. Most acute ischemic strokes will not be visualized on a CT scan in the early hours of a stroke.

The  differential  diagnosis  for  SAH  is  broad  and  includes  intracranial hemorrhage, drug toxicity, ischemic stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial  tumor,  venous  sinus  thrombosis,  and  primary  headache  syndromes. Modern CT scanners are reported to be 98% sensitive to detect SAH within 6 to 12 hours of symptom onset, 91% to 93% at 24 hours, and 50% at 1 week. If SAH is suspected and the CT is negative, many clinicians recommend a lumbar puncture to assess for the presence of red blood cells or xanthochromia as evidence of subarachnoid blood that was not visualized on CT scan. However, some recent studies have challenged this position and suggest that

a lumbar puncture may be unnecessary if a third-generation CT scan done within 6 hours of symptom onset is interpreted as negative by a neuroradiologist.  A  growing  body  of  literature  is  exploring  the  combination  of  a negative noncontrast CT with CT angiography to exclude SAH or an associated aneurysm, with a 99.4% reported negative predictive value of this combination.  However,  potential  downsides  to  this  diagnostic  strategy  are  the additional  ionizing  radiation  exposure  and  possible  detection  of  incidental cerebral aneurysms.

Others recommend beginning the workup in the ED, starting antiplatelet therapy in appropriate patients, providing education about risk modification, and giving explicit return precautions. An individualized approach to select low-risk, asymptomatic patients may depend on medical factors, available healthcare resources, and a favorable social situation.

# Altered Mental Status and Coma

C. Crawford Mechem

Mental status is the clinical state of emotional and intellectual functioning of an individual. Patients presenting with altered mental status in the ED can include the diagnoses of delirium, dementia, and coma.

# ■ DELIRIUM

# Clinical Features

Delirium is a transient disorder characterized by impaired attention, perception, thinking, memory, and cognition. Typically, delirium develops over a time  course  of  days.  Sleep-wake  cycles  may  be  disrupted,  with  patients exhibiting increased somnolence during the day and agitation characteristic of sundowning at night. Levels of alertness may be reduced, and activity levels  may  fluctuate  rapidly.  Different  caregivers  witnessing  completely different patient behaviors within a brief time span may complicate making the diagnosis. Tremor, asterixis, tachycardia, sweating, hypertension, emotional outbursts, and hallucinations may be present. Features of delirium, dementia, and psychiatric disorders are listed in Table 142-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The acute onset of attention deficits and cognitive abnormalities fluctuating throughout the day and worsening at night is characteristic of delirium. A detailed medication history should be obtained, as well as a mental status evaluation. ED evaluation is directed at identifying an underlying process contributing to the development of delirium such as infection (Table 142-2). Ancillary tests may include basic metabolic panel, hepatic studies, ammonia level, urinalysis, complete blood count, and chest radiograph. Cranial CT should be performed if a mass lesion is suspected, and clinicians may consider  doing  a  lumbar  puncture  if  meningitis  or  subarachnoid  hemorrhage is suspected and an alternative diagnosis is not established.

# ■ DEMENtIa

# Clinical Features

Dementia implies a loss of mental capacity over time. Psychosocial level and cognitive abilities deteriorate and behavioral problems develop. The largest  categories  of  dementia  are  Alzheimer's  disease  and  vascular dementia, and onset is typically insidious with gradual and progressive impairment of memory, especially recent memory. Hallucinations, delusions, and repetitive behaviors may be present. Other features of dementia include naming problems, forgetting items, loss of reading and direction,

--- Page 797 ---

CHAPTER 142: Altered Mental Status and Coma

disorientation,  inability  to  perform  self-care  tasks,  and  personality changes.  Anxiety,  depression,  and  speech  difficulties  may  be  observed. Patients with vascular dementia may be noted to have exaggerated or asymmetric deep tendon reflexes, gait abnormalities, or extremity weakness.

# Diagnosis and Differential

While dementia typically develops slowly over time, physical examination may  identify  a  precipitant  or  underlying  cause  of  an  acute  or  subacute change in a patient's level of functioning. Focal neurologic signs suggest the possibility of vascular dementia or a mass lesion. Increased motor tone and other extrapyramidal signs may suggest Parkinson's disease. Consider normal pressure hydrocephalus if urinary incontinence and gait disturbance are noted. This is further suggested by excessively large ventricles on head CT. Diagnostic studies may include a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, urinalysis, thyroid profile, serum vitamin B 12 level, testing for syphilis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum folate level, human immunodeficiency  virus  testing,  and  chest  radiography.  Consider  head  CT  or MRI as well as lumbar puncture if the diagnosis is not readily apparent and intracranial  processes  or  central  nervous  system  infections  are  suspected causes. The differential diagnosis includes delirium, depression, and other treatable causes.

# Clinical Features

Coma is a state of reduced alertness and responsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused. Severity can be quantified using the Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 142-3) and the FOUR (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) score. Pupillary findings, cranial nerve testing, findings of hemiparesis,  and  response  to  stimulation  can  help  the  clinician  to  determine  a probable  general  category:  diffuse  CNS  dysfunction  such  as  a  toxicmetabolic  coma  or  focal  CNS  dysfunction  characteristic  of  structural coma.  Toxic-metabolic  coma  is  characterized  by  lack  of  focal  physical examination findings. The pupils are typically small and reactive, but may be large in severe sedative poisoning as from barbiturates.

Coma from supratentorial lesions or masses may present with progressive hemiparesis or asymmetric muscle tone and reflexes. Coma without

lateralizing  signs  may  result  from  decreased  cerebral  perfusion  from increased intracranial pressure (ICP). In addition, reflex changes in blood pressure  and  heart  rate  may  be  observed,  such  as  the  Cushing  reflex (hypertension and bradycardia). Coma from posterior fossa or infratentorial lesions may be abrupt in onset, with abnormal extensor posturing and loss  of  pupillary  reflexes  and  extraocular  movements.  Brainstem  compression  with  loss  of  brainstem  reflexes  may  develop  rapidly.  Pontine hemorrhage, another infratentorial cause of coma, may present with pinpoint pupils.

Pseudocoma  or  psychogenic  coma  is  a  diagnostic  challenge.  History taking and observation of responses to stimulation reveal findings that differ from typical syndromes. Pupillary responses, extraocular movements, muscle  tone,  and  reflexes  are  intact. Valuable  tests  include  responses  to manual eye opening (there should be little or no resistance in an unresponsive  patient)  and  extraocular  movements.  If  avoidance  of  gaze  is  consistently seen with the patient always looking away from the examiner, or if nystagmus  is  demonstrated  with  caloric  vestibular  testing,  this  is  strong evidence for nonphysiologic or feigned unresponsiveness.

# Diagnosis and Differential

History, examination, laboratory studies, and neuroimaging will often identify potential causes for a comatose state. Abrupt onset of coma suggests a catastrophic stroke or status epilepticus. Gradual onset suggests a metabolic process or progressive lesion such as a tumor or a slowly developing intracranial  bleed.  Examination  may  reveal  signs  of  trauma  or  suggest  other

779

possibilities,  such  as  toxidromes.  Fine  neurologic  testing  is  not  feasible with a comatose patient, but asymmetric findings on pupillary examination, assessment of corneal reflexes, and testing of oculovestibular reflexes may suggest focal CNS lesions. Extensor or flexor posturing suggests profound CNS  dysfunction.  A  head  CT  should  be  obtained  followed  by  lumbar puncture if the scan is nondiagnostic and a subarachnoid hemorrhage or infection  is  suspected.  Basilar  artery  thrombosis  may  be  a  concern  in  a comatose patient with a nondiagnostic head CT and an absence of alternative diagnoses; MRI or cerebral angiography may be considered to evaluate for  this  potential  diagnosis.  Patients  who  have  had  seizures  and  remain unresponsive may be having electrical seizures without motor activity (nonconvulsive status epilepticus), and an EEG should be performed if this is suspected. Consider toxic ingestions, infections, and nonaccidental trauma in comatose children. The differential diagnosis of coma includes primary CNS disorders (Table 142-4) and generalized disease processes that also affect the brain.

# Ataxia and Gait Disturbances

Ross J. Fleischman

Ataxia  is  uncoordinated  movement  while  a  gait  disorder  is  an  abnormal pattern or style of walking. Both of these are findings that can be associated with  many  different  disease  processes,  and  thus  clinicians  evaluating patients with these abnormalities should view them in the context of individual clinical circumstances.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

When initially evaluating a patient with ataxia or a gait distubance, consider whether the observed abonormalities are secondary manifestations of systemic disease rather than primary neurologic processes. Key symptoms that may  suggest  systemic  disease  include  headache,  nausea,  fever,  and decreased  level  of  alertness.  The  physical  examination  may  also  show abnormalities outside of the nervous system, such as orthostatic vital sign changes  that  can  point  to  hypovolemia  or  other  systemic  illness.  Some forms of nystagmus may be suggestive of a central nervous system (CNS) disease process.

When evaluating ataxia that is suspected as a primary problem, differentiate  between  motor  and  sensory  causes.  One  finding  that  suggests  a cerebellar motor lesion is dysmetria, which can be elicited by finger to nose testing where patients may undershoot or overshoot their movements. Dysdiadochokinesia may be elicited by having the patient alternately flip their palms and backs of their hands on their thighs where clumsy rapid alternating movements can be observed. Heel to shin testing by having the patient slide  one  heel  down  the  opposite  shin  can  be  useful  for  distinguishing between  primary  cerebellar  disease  and  other  sensory  processing  abnormalities. Overshoot of the knee or ankle signifies cerebellar disease, while a wavering course down the shin suggests a deficit of proprioception.

The Romberg test is primarily a test of sensation and can help to distinguish sensory ataxia from motor disease. Unsteadiness with the eyes open suggests a cerebellar motor ataxia, whereas worsening symptoms with eyes closed  suggests  a  sensory  ataxia  that  is  unmasked  with  the  removal  of visual  input. Test  the  posterior  columns  of  the  spinal  cord  by  evaluating vibration and position sense in the lower extremities. Abnormalities attributed to posterior column degeneration can occur in tabes dorsalis (neurosyphilis) and vitamin B 12 deficiency.

Observe patient ambulation in the emergency department to fully evaluate potential ataxia or gait disturbances. Subtle proximal or distal weakness can be identified by observing the patient rise from a chair and walk on heels and toes. Tandem heel-to-toe walking may elicit subtle ataxia. Broadbased,  unsteady  steps  are  characteristic  of  a  motor  ataxic  gait,  while  a sensory ataxia with loss of proprioception may be notable for abrupt movements and slapping of the feet with each impact. A senile gait that is slow, broad based, and with a shortened stride may be seen with aging, but also with  neurodegenerative  disease  such  as  Parkinson's  disease  and  normal

pressure hydrocephalus. Patients with Parkinson's disease often develop a narrow-based festinating gait with small shuffling steps that become more rapid.  Weakness  of  the  peroneal  muscle  weakness  can  manifest  as  foot drop, and is known as an equine gait.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Table 143-1 shows common causes of acute ataxia and gait disturbances.

Tailor the extent of ED evaluation based on the acuity and severity of symptoms. Patients with an acute onset of new symptoms or recent progression of symptoms will often undergo a more extensive diagnostic workup. Obtain radiographic imaging with CT scan or MRI when clinically indicated. Obtain a lumbar puncture to analyse cerebrospinal fluid when a CNS infection is suspected.

Wernicke's  encephalopathy  is  characterized  by  ataxia,  altered  mental status, and ophthalmoplegia. While it is classically associated with alcoholics, this disease can be seen in any malnourished individual. Nystagmus is the most common ocular finding. Vestibular damage may cause unsteadiness

while standing still, cerebellar damage may cause motor ataxia, and sensory  neuropathy  may  also  be  present.  Confabulation  characterizes  the memory loss of Korsakoff's syndrome. Consider vitamin B 12 deficiency in patients with loss of position sense in the second toe and a positive Romberg test. A serum cyanocobalamin level and complete blood count are the initial steps in evaluation, although neurologic manifestations often precede macrocytic anemia. Neurosyphilis will cause similar symptoms of posterior column disease  and  can  be  screened  for  with VDRL  or  RPR  tests.  Gait impairments can also present in elderly patients as manifestations of Parkinson's disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Ingestions are a common cause of acute ataxia in children. Ataxia in a 2- to 4-year-old may follow recent immunizations, viral illnesses, or varicella. Cranial nerve abnormalities or motor dysfunction along with cerebellar abnormalities may be present with posterior fossa mass lesions. Chaotic eye movements (opsoclonus) and myoclonic jerks of the head and chest are most commonly associated with neuroblastomas of the chest or abdomen. In the absence of post-varicella ataxia or another identifiable cause, clinicians  can  consider  neuroimaging,  lumbar  puncture,  and  consultation  as clinically indicated.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Vertigo is a perception of movement when none exists that results from a mismatch between the visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory systems. Symptoms of vertigo are classically described by patients as a sensation that 'the room is spinning,' but can also include atypical sensations of other  types  of  movement.  Vertigo  is  classified  as  peripheral  or  central (Table 144-1). Peripheral vertigo (involving the vestibular apparatus and eighth cranial nerve) usually has a sudden onset with intense symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, intolerance of head movement, and diaphoresis. Central  vertigo (involving  central  structures  such  as  the  brainstem  or cerebellum) can present either abruptly or gradually, but usually is characterized by less severe symptoms that are not well characterized by patients. Clinicians  can  work  to  discriminate  between  these  two  types  of  vertigo during a care encounter in the Emergency Department (ED) while recognizing that some overlap may exist between these two types of vertigo.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

key features during the history and physical examination. Inquire about the speed of symptom onset, severity, duration, temporal pattern, head or neck trauma,  chiropractic  manipulation,  and  any  associated  symptoms  such  as headache, neck pain, or loss of consciousness. Assess risk factors for stroke such as age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and coagulopathy. Physical examination should include eye (e.g. , nystagmus), ear, vestibular, and neurological examinations, with particular attention to potential abnormalities of the cranial nerves or cerebellar function. Since focal deficits are not universal in central vertigo, further specialized neurological tests may be of value in some patients. HINTS testing consists of the Head Impulse test (evaluation of  the  vestibulo-ocular  reflex),  examination  for  Nystagmus  direction  that changes with gaze direction, and Test of Skew (vertical ocular misalignment during the cover-uncover eye test). The presence of one or more findings on the HINTS exam that are consistent with central vertigo has been reported to be sensitive and specific for stroke when completed by experts, although it is unclear whether this specific testing is useful for physicians without special training.  If  benign  paroxysmal  positional  vertigo  (BPPV)  is  suspected,  a Dix-Hallpike maneuver may be useful to help make the diagnosis (sensitivity 75% to 82%). Physical examination maneuvers that involve head or neck twisting should not be used if cervical artery dissection, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or spinal pathology are suspected.

Laboratory  investigations  are  not  typically  indicated  in  the  routine workup  for  patients  with  symptoms  consistent  with  peripheral  vertigo, unless there is strong suspicion of a specific cause where laboratory analysis would be helpful. Neuroimaging studies such as an emergent CT scan,

--- Page 806 ---

786

SECTION 15: Neurology

CT angiogram, MRI, or MR angiogram are not routinely indicated when peripheral vertigo is suspected, but may be useful when specific causes of central vertigo are significant concerns. Consider neuroimaging in elderly patients  with  signs  or  symptoms  concerning  for  central  vertigo  (such  as cranial nerve or cerebellar findings), significant stroke risks, coagulopathy (e.g. , taking anticoagulant medications), headache, head or neck trauma, or intractable or persistent ( > 72 hours) symptoms.

# ■ CAUSES OF pERIphERAL VERTIGO

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is believed to be caused by loose otoconia that most commonly enter the posterior semicircular canal and cause the inappropriate sensation of motion. Findings suggestive of BPPV are listed in Table 144-3. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can support the diagnosis. To perform this physical examination maneuver, begin with the patient seated with the head turned 45° to the right. Rapidly lower the patient to a supine position, with the head hanging over the edge of the bed and the neck in 20° of extension. A positive test is when patients experience a short-lived rotatory nystagmus, with rapid eye beating toward the affected (dependent) ear that is associated with an acute episode of vertigo. After any nystagmus or symptoms resolve, slowly return the patient to the sitting position. Repeat the maneuver with the head turned 45° to the left. The side with the positive test serves as the starting point for the potentially curative Epley maneuver (see below).

Ménière's  syndrome is  characterized  by  recurrent  bouts  of  vertigo associated with unilateral tinnitus and a sense of fullness and diminished hearing  in  the  affected  ear.  Because  the  diagnosis  requires  multiple  episodes of attacks with progressive hearing loss, Ménière's syndrome is not typically diagnosed on the first presentation of vertigo.

A perilymph  fistula presents  with  sudden  onset  of  vertigo  during activities  that  can  cause  barotrauma  such  as  flying,  scuba  diving,  heavy lifting, and coughing. Infection can also cause a perilymph fistula, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by nystagmus elicited by pneumatic otoscopy.

Vestibular neuronitis is  characterized  by  the  sudden  onset  of  severe vertigo sometimes associated with unilateral tinnitus and hearing loss. It is the second most common cause of peripheral vertigo, and is thought to be viral in nature. Symptoms last several days to weeks before they resolve spontaneously without recurrence.

Vestibular ganglionitis causes vertigo when a neurotrophic virus such as  varicella  zoster  reactivates.  The  most  famous  variant  is  Ramsay  Hunt syndrome (deafness, vertigo, and facial nerve palsy), which is associated with vesicles inside the external auditory canal.

Labyrinthitis , although commonly viral, can also be caused by bacterial infection from otitis media, meningitis, and mastoiditis. Patients with labyrinthitis present with a sudden onset of vertigo with hearing loss and middle ear findings.

Ototoxicity may induce hearing loss and vertigo. Common offenders causing peripheral ototoxicity include NSAIDs, salicylates, aminoglycosides,

# TAble 144-3 Supportive Findings in Benign paroxysmal positional Vertigo

Latency period of < 30 sec between the provocative head position and onset of nystagmus. The intensity of nystagmus increases to a peak before slowly resolving.

Duration of vertigo and nystagmus ranges from 5 to 40 sec.

If nystagmus is produced in one direction by placing the head down, then the nystagmus reverses direction when the head is returned to the sitting position.

Repeated head positioning causes both the vertigo and accompanying nystagmus to fatigue and subside.

loop diuretics, and cytotoxic agents. Anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants,  neuroleptics,  hydrocarbons,  alcohol,  and  phencyclidine  may  cause centrally mediated vertigo.

Tumors of the eighth cranial nerve and cerebellopontine angle , such as meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, and acoustic schwannomas, may present with hearing loss and subsequent gradual onset of mild vertigo. Ataxia, ipsilateral facial weakness, loss of the corneal reflex, and cerebellar signs can also occur.

Vertigo may occur after closed head injury (e.g., basilar skull fracture) and tends to resolve over several weeks. In the acute setting, injuries with an associated intracranial hemorrhage should be excluded with neuroimaging. Postconcussive syndrome can also develop subacutely and may include an unsteady gait with dizziness.

# ■ CAUSES OF CENTRAL VERTIGO

Cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction typically causes moderate vertigo symptoms  and  can  be  associated  with  headache,  nausea,  and  vomiting. Cerebellar findings such as truncal ataxia, abnormal Romberg testing, and tandem gait abnormalities are often present.

Lateral  medullary  infarction  of  the  brainstem (Wallenberg  syndrome) causes vertigo and ipsilateral facial numbness, loss of the corneal reflex, Horner syndrome, dysphagia, and dysphonia. Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the extremities also occur.

Vertebrobasilar  insufficiency may  result  in  sudden  vertigo  due  to brainstem transient ischemic attack that typically lasts from minutes to 24 hours. Diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, vision changes, and syncope may also  be  present.  Unlike  other  causes  of  central  vertigo,  vertebrobasilar insufficiency may be induced by movement of the head that is caused by positional decreases in vertebral artery blood flow.

Vertebral artery dissection can be caused by mechanisms that induce a sudden rotation of the head such as a motor vehicle crash, chiropractic adjustments,  or  violent  sneezing.  Patients  present  with  central  vertigo, headache, neck pain, and a unilateral Horner's syndrome.

Other  potential  causes  of  central  vertigo  include  multiple  sclerosis, neoplasms of the fourth ventricle, and vestibular migraine.

A seizure is an episode of abnormal neurologic function caused by the inappropriate electrical discharge of brain neurons. Primary seizures are those without an identified specific cause. Secondary seizures result from another identifiable  neurologic  condition,  such  as  a  mass,  head  injury,  or  stroke (Table 145-1).

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Seizures are classified as generalized or partial .  Generalized seizures are characterized by widespread involvement of the entire cerebral cortex and are typically associated with an abrupt loss of consciousness. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures ( grand mal ) often begin with a sudden onset of muscle rigidity where the trunk and extremities are extended and the patient falls to  the  ground.  This  rigid  (tonic)  phase  is  followed  by  a  symmetric  and rhythmic (clonic) jerking of the trunk and extremities. Generalized seizures are  commonly  associated  with  incontinence  and  an  immediate  postictal period where the patient remains flaccid and unconscious. A typical episode may last from 60 to 90 seconds with a gradual return of consciousness afterwards,  although  postictal  confusion  may  persist  for  hours. Absence ( petit mal ) seizures are a subclass of generalized seizures typically seen in

school-aged children and often last only a few seconds. Patients suddenly lose  consciousness  without  losing  postural  tone  and  appear  confused, detached, or withdrawn. An absence seizure typically ends abruptly with a return to normal functioning.

Partial seizures are due to electrical discharges that begin in a localized region of the cerebral cortex. These seizures may remain localized to one area of the brain or may later spread to other regions. Partial seizures are described as simple , in which consciousness is not affected, or complex , in which consciousness is altered. Complex partial seizures are often due to discharges in the temporal lobe (also termed temporal lobe seizures )  and may  include  automatisms,  visceral  complaints,  hallucinations,  memory disturbances, distorted perception, and affective disorders.

Status  epilepticus is  defined  as  a  single  seizure  lasting  for  longer than 5  minutes, or as two or more seizures that occur sequentially without  an  intervening  recovery  of  consciousness. Nonconvulsive  status epilepticus is characterized by altered mental status without perceptible muscular convulsive activity and is confirmed by electroencephalogram (EEG).

Eclampsia is a disorder found in pregnant women from 20 weeks gestation up to 8 weeks postpartum and is characterized by generalized seizures, hypertension, edema, and proteinuria.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

When a patient presents with seizure-like activity, obtain a detailed history and inquire about the presence of preceding aura, abrupt or gradual onset,  progression  of  motor  activity,  incontinence,  whether  the  activity was local or generalized, symmetry of symptoms, duration of the episode, and  presence  of  postictal  confusion  or  lethargy.  When  a  patient  has  a previously  diagnosed  seizure  disorder,  inquire  about  their  baseline  seizure pattern, common precipitants, and any recent changes in antiepileptic  regimen.  For  those  patients  without  a  history  of  seizures,  ask  about recent  or  remote  head  injury.    Consider  the  possibility  of  intracranial pathology  if  persistent,  severe,  or  sudden-onset  headaches  are  present. Consider eclampsia in patients with a current or recent pregnancy. Other factors that may predispose to seizures include metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, systemic illness, cancer, sequelae of coagulopathy  or  anticoagulation,  exposure  to  industrial  or  environmental  toxins, drug ingestion or withdrawal, and alcohol use. Seizures are a common manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) disease in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus.

Evaluate each patient for findings of physical injuries that may have occurred during the seizure, perform a neurologic exam, and closely follow the level of consciousness. A transient focal deficit following a simple or complex focal seizure is referred to as Todd's paralysis and typically  resolves  within  48  hours.  Initiate  appropriate  further  testing  for neurologic  findings  that  are  new  or  cannot  be  readily  attributed  to  a benign cause.

Laboratory  testing  should  be  individualized  and  may  not  be  indicated in all circumstances. In a patient with a known seizure disorder who has had a typical seizure, a glucose level and pertinent anticonvulsant

levels  may  be  appropriate.  In  an  adult  with  a  first  seizure,  additional studies are often used to assess for medical causes of seizure and may include serum glucose, basic metabolic panel, calcium, magnesium, a pregnancy test, and toxicology studies, as indicated. A noncontrast head CT is appropriate for a patient with a first seizure or a change in seizure pattern to identify a structural lesion or an acute intracranial process. Additional neuroradiographic imaging may be indicated based on CT scan results or clinical circumstances. MRI is typically not necessary on an  emergent  basis,  but  is  often  recommended  as  an  aspect  of  nonemergent  outpatient  follow-up  for  patients  with  a  first-time  seizure. Lumbar puncture is indicated if CNS infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected.

The differential diagnosis of seizures includes syncope, pseudoseizures, hyperventilation syndrome, movement disorders, and migraines.

A systematic approach to evaluating neurologic symptoms includes localizing  the  problem  anatomically  and  distinguishing  peripheral  disorders from those with a central etiology. Peripheral nerve disorders may affect sensory, motor, and autonomic functions (Table 146-1).

# ■ GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME

# Clinical Features

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyneuropathy characterized by immune-mediated peripheral nerve myelin sheath or axon destruction. It can be associated with a viral or febrile illness, Campylobacter jejuni infection, or vaccination.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Although  numerous  variants  exist,  the  typical  presentation  from  GBS includes ascending symmetric weakness or paralysis and loss of deep tendon  reflexes.  Respiratory  failure  and  significant  autonomic  fluctuations may occur. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows high protein and a normal cell count (Table 146-2).

# ■ BELL'S pALSY

# Clinical Features

Bell's palsy causes seventh cranial nerve dysfunction. Patients may complain of facial weakness, articulation problems, difficulty keeping an eye closed, or inability to keep food in the mouth on one side.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Physical  examination  findings  demonstrate  weakness  on  one  side  of  the face, including the forehead, without other focal neurologic findings. The differential diagnosis includes stroke, Lyme disease, GBS, parotid tumors, middle  ear  lesions,  cerebellopontine  angle  tumors,  eighth  cranial  nerve lesions, HIV, and vascular disease. Inspect the ear for ulcerations caused by cranial herpes zoster activation, which is diagnostic for Ramsey-Hunt syndrome. Bell's Palsy is not likely if muscle strength is retained in the forehead  on  examination,  and  such  a  finding  suggests  a  possible  central neurologic lesion warranting radiographic imaging of the brain.

798 SECTION 15: Neurology

# ■ FOCAL MONONEUROpAthIES

# Clinical Features

Focal mononeuropathies are most often due to focal nerve compression, although  some  systemic  processes  may  also  lead  to  mononeuropathy. Examples include carpal tunnel syndrome, resulting from compression of the median nerve at the wrist, and cubital tunnel syndrome, resulting from compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Carpal  tunnel  syndrome  causes  pain,  paresthesias,  and  numbness  in  the distribution of the medial nerve. The presence of Tinel's sign (light percussion over median nerve at wrist results in electric shock sensation shooting into hand) and use of Phalen's maneuver (holding wrists in flexion for 60 seconds worsens symptoms) may help confirm the diagnosis. Cubital tunnel syndrome causes tingling in the fifth and lateral fourth fingers that may progress to paralysis and wasting of the intrinsic hand muscles. Other common focal  neuropathies  include  deep  peroneal  entrapment  (causing  foot drop  and  numbness  between  the  first  and  second  toes),  meralgia  paresthetica  (entrapment  of  the  lateral  femoral  cutaneous  nerve  causing numbness and pain of the anterolateral thigh), and mononeuritis multiplex (dysfunction  of  multiple  peripheral  nerves  separated  temporally  and anatomically).

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ pLEXOpAthIES

Plexopathies  can  be  caused  by  trauma,  surgery,  neoplasm,  or  radiation therapy.  Brachial  plexopathy  causes  weakness  in  the  arm  or  shoulder girdle followed by pain and paresthesias. Patients have weakness in various  distributions  of  the  brachial  plexus.  ED  evaluation  is  directed  at identifying  acutely  reversible  causes,  such  as  joint  dislocation  or  traumatic injury, and referral for other causes, such as neoplasm. Lumbosacral plexopathy is less likely due to injury and can be caused by radiation, diabetic  amyotrophy,  aortic  aneurysm,  retroperitoneal  hemorrhage,  or

arteriovenous malformations. Symptoms are weakness, decreased sensation,  and  possibly  decreased  reflexes  in  the  areas  innervated  by  the affected portions of the plexus. Plain radiographs, MRI, and abdominal CT may be useful in determining the etiology. Direct specific treatment at the underlying cause.

# ■ NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCtION DISORDERS

Botulism is a toxin-mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is caused  by Clostridium  botulinum toxin.  Foodborne  botulism  typically comes  from  improperly  preserved  canned  foods.  In  infantile  botulism, organisms arise from ingested spores, often in honey, and produce a systemically absorbed toxin. Clinical features appear 6 to 48 hours after ingestion  and  may  be  preceded  by  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea.  Consider wound botulism in patients with a wound or a history of intravenous drug use. Early complaints involve the eye or bulbar musculature and progress to symmetric descending weakness and potential respiratory insufficiency. Treatment includes respiratory support, trivalent botulinum antitoxin 10 mL  IV,  and  admission.  For  infants, human  botulism  immunoglobulin decreases mechanical ventilation requirements and length of intensive care unit stays.

Patients with chronic neurologic disorders may present to the emergency department  with  complications  of  their  underlying  medical  conditions. Emergency management of these disorders often centers on evaluation of potential respiratory complications and an assessment for appropriate inpatient or outpatient management of acute illness or exacerbation of chronic disease.

# ■ AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience progressive muscle  atrophy and weakness.  Limb  spasticity, hyperreflexia, and emotional lability are common symptoms of upper motor neuron demyelination, while lower motor neuron dysfunction can cause muscle weakness, atrophy, fasciculations, dysarthria, dysphagia, and difficulty with mastication. In the early phase of disease, symptoms may be asymmetric. Respiratory muscle weakness causes progressive respiratory difficulty that presents as dyspnea with exertion or at rest. Sensory and cognitive function is often spared, although up to 15% of patients may also develop dementia and Parkinsonism.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis early in the course of illness can be challenging, which contributes to a median time to diagnosis of 14 months. Clinicians may suspect ALS when signs are found of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction without other central nervous system dysfunction. Other diagnoses to consider  that  may  have  ALS-like  symptoms  are  systemic  illnesses  such  as diabetes,  thyroid  and  parathyroid  dysfunction,  vitamin  B 12 deficiency, heavy metal toxicity, vasculitis, and CNS tumors.

normal increases the likelihood of pneumonia and respiratory failure in these patients.

# ■ MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

# Clinical Features

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. Most patients have weakness of proximal extremity muscles, neck extensors, and facial or bulbar muscles. Ptosis and diplopia are common presenting symptoms, and symptoms typically worsen as the day progresses and improve with rest.  Severe  respiratory  muscle  weakness  causing  respiratory  failure  is characteristic of a myasthenic crisis.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The symptoms of myasthenia gravis can mimic those seen in many other disorders, including Lambert-Eaton syndrome, botulism, thyroid disorders, and stroke. The diagnosis can be established through administration of edrophonium (an acetylecholinesterase inhibitor), electromyography, and serum testing for acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Edrophonium or neostigmine is  expected  to  improve  muscle  strength  in  objectively weak limb and ocular or pharyngeal muscles and can help make an initial diagnosis.

# ■ MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

# Clinical Features

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is caused by multifocal areas of CNS demyelination and manifests with motor, sensory, visual, and/or cerebellar dysfunction.  Types  of  MS  include  relapsing  and  remitting  (90%),  relapsing  and progressive,  and  chronically  progressive.  Lhermitte  sign  is  commonly experienced and is described as an electric shock sensation, vibration, or pain radiating  down the back and often into the arms or legs from neck flexion.  Physical  examination  may  show  decreased  strength,  increased tone, hyperreflexia, clonus, decrease in vibratory sense and joint proprioception, a positive Babinski reflex, and reduced pain and temperature sense. Optic neuritis with loss of central vision is a presenting symptom in 30% of cases and may cause an afferent papillary defect (Marcus-Gunn pupil). Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia causes abnormal eye adduction and

horizontal nystagmus, and its presence is strongly suggestive of MS. Cognitive and emotional problems are common as the disease progresses.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A diagnosis of MS is suspected when a patient experiences two or more prolonged  episodes  of  neurologic  dysfunction  that  suggest  white  matter pathology in more than one location in the brain and/or spinal cord. MRI shows multiple discrete lesions in the supratentorial white matter, homogeneous borders around the ventricles, or infratentorial or spinal cord lesions. CSF protein and γ -globulin levels are often elevated. Other conditions that mimic symptoms of MS include systemic lupus erythematosus, Lyme disease, neurosyphilis, HIV disease, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

# ■ LAMBERT-EATON MYASTHENIC SYNDROME

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is an autoimmune disorder with fluctuating  proximal  limb  muscle  weakness  and  fatigue.  It  is  classically described in older men with lung cancer. Strength improves with sustained or repeated exercise (Lambert sign). Patients complain of myalgias, stiffness,  paresthesias,  metallic  tastes,  and  autonomic  symptoms.  Eye  movements are unaffected. Electromyography is abnormal, and serum tests are specific  for  antibodies  to  voltage-gated  calcium  channels.  Treatment  is mostly supportive, but neuromuscular transmission can also be enhanced with 3,4-diaminopyridine .  Immunosuppressive drugs may reduce symptom severity.

# ■ PARKINSON'S DISEASE

# Clinical Features

Parkinson's  disease  is  a  progressive  extrapyramidal  movement  disorder with four classic signs: resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia or akinesia,  and  impaired  posture  and  equilibrium.  Initially,  many  patients develop a unilateral resting upper extremity tremor, referred to as a 'pill rolling' tremor, which improves with intentional movement.

--- Page 824 ---

804 SECTION 15: Neurology

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is clinical and based on the presence of the four classic signs. Parkinsonism can secondarily develop from exposure to illicit drugs, toxins, neuroleptic medications, hydrocephalus, head trauma,  and  other  rare  neurologic  conditions.  Drug-induced  Parkinson's disease most commonly presents with akinesia. No radiographic imaging or laboratory study is pathognomonic for making the diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Most patients with known Parkinson's disease are treated with medications that increase central dopamine, have anticholinergic properties, or act  as  central  dopamine  receptor  agonists.  Medication  side  effects  may include  psychiatric  or  sleep  disturbances,  anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting, cardiac dysrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesias, and dystonia. Patients  being  treated  with  medication  for  Parkinson's  disease  who present  with  new  motor  or  psychiatric  disturbances  or  decreased  drug efficacy, a 'drug holiday' for 1 week can be considered in consultation with a neurologist.

# ■ POLIOMYELITIS AND POSTPOLIO SYNDROME

# Clinical Features

Poliomyelitis is caused by an enterovirus infection that can lead to paralysis by  motor  neuron  destruction  and  muscle  denervation  in  some  patients. Most acutely infected patients are asymptomatic or have a mild viral syndrome without paralysis. Major illness occurs in only 1% to 2% of infections and most commonly involves the spinal cord, resulting in asymmetric proximal limb weakness and flaccidity, absent tendon reflexes, and fasciculations. Maximal paralysis occurs within 5 days and is followed by muscle atrophy.  Paralysis  will  resolve  within  1  year  in  most  patients.  Other sequelae include autonomic dysfunction, speech and swallowing dysfunction, and encephalitis. Polio was eradicated from the United States in 1979 but is still endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

Postpolio syndrome is the recurrence of motor symptoms after a latent period of several decades in a patient who has a history of acute paralytic poliomyelitis. Symptoms may include muscle fatigue, joint pain, or weakness of new and previously affected muscle groups. Patients may have new bulbar, respiratory, or sleep difficulties.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Consider  an  acute  polio  virus  infection  when  an  at-risk  patient  from  an endemic area presents with an acute febrile illness, aseptic meningitis, and asymmetric  flaccid  paralysis  with  loss  of  deep  tendon  reflexes  and  preserved sensation. The diagnosis can be made by evaluating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which will demonstrate a pleocytosis and positive viral cultures for poliovirus, or from throat or rectal swab testing.

Other  diseases  with  similar  neurologic  symptoms  include  GuillainBarré  syndrome,  peripheral  neuropathies  associated  with  other  disorders (e.g.,  mononucleosis,  Lyme  disease,  or  porphyria),  abnormal  electrolyte

805

levels,  toxins,  inflammatory  myopathies,  and  other  viral  infections (e.g., Coxsackie, mumps, echovirus, and various enteroviruses).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Acute care for patients suffering from a postpolio syndrome is supportive, with  analgesics  and  anti-inflammatory  medications.  Muscle  training  and daily exercise regimens are helpful. Lamotrigine may improve quality of life for patients with postpolio syndrome. Consultation with a neurologist is recommended for disposition and continued follow-up treatment.

Identifying infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can be challenging for clinicians in the Emergency Department (ED), as invasive testing is often required for definitive diagnoses. Bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis,  brain abscess, and spinal epidural abscess are life-threatening emergencies that can initially present with a spectrum of nonspecific symptoms that  may  make  early  diagnosis  difficult.  Differentiating  these  conditions from viral meningitis or other conditions that can be treated with supportive care is important when a CNS infection is suspected.

# ■ MENINGITIS AND ENCEPHALITIS

# Clinical Features

Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Bacterial meningitis is inflammation caused by infection, often with  encapsulated  organisms,  and  is  a  life-threatening  emergency.  Even with  appropriate  and  timely  treatment  this  emergent  CNS  infection  can have significant morbidity and mortality. Aseptic meningitis is diagnosed when such  inflammation  is  due  to  causes  other  than  bacterial  infection, such as drug reactions, rheumatologic conditions, or nonbacterial infections such as fungi or viruses. Enteroviruses and echoviruses are the most common causes of aseptic meningitis.

The classically described clinical triad of meningitis is fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status, although less than half of patients will initially  present  with  all  three  of  these  features.  Headache  is  a  common symptom and fever is often present. Many initial symptoms such as headache, fever, neck pain, nausea, and vomiting are nonspecific and overlap with  other  more  common  conditions,  which  can  make  early  diagnosis  a challenge especially in very young and very old patients.

Physical  findings  often  include  fever,  and  when  CNS  infection  is suspected clinicians should evaluate for the presence of meningeal signs such as nuchal rigidity (severe neck stiffness), Kernig's sign (pain in the back and legs with flexing the hip and extending the knee), and Brudzinski's  sign  (flexion  of  the  hips  with  passive  flexion  of  the  neck), although these classically described findings have been demonstrated to have poor sensitivity for meningitis. Evaluate mental status and look for potential neurological deficits that may accompany CNS infections such as  cranial  nerve  palsies  or  other  focal  findings.  Examine  the  skin  for petechiae,  splinter  hemorrhages,  or  other  findings  concerning  for  systemic infection.

Encephalitis is an infection of the brain parenchyma that causes inflammation within the CNS and is often caused by viral infection. This can be caused by a number of different viral pathogens including herpes simplex virus  (HSV),  which is  the  most  treatable  cause  of  encephalitis.  Patients with acute viral encephalitis will present with many of the same signs and

806

CHAPTER 148: Central Nervous System and Spinal Infections

807

symptoms as bacterial meningitis, such as fever, stiff neck, or headache. Additionally, patients diagnosed with encephalitis typically present with altered mental status, cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, or seizures.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A  promptly  performed  lumbar  puncture  (LP)  to  obtain  cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF)  is  the  appropriate  diagnostic  procedure  for  patients  with suspected  meningitis  or  encephalitis.  Consider  a  CT  scan  of  the  brain before  the  procedure  when  altered  mental  status,  new  onset  seizures, immunocompromise, focal neurologic signs, or papilledema are present. The  goal  for  imaging  in  this  circumstance  is  to  identify  possible contraindications to LP such as an occult mass or signs of brain shift or herniation (see Fig. 148-1).

Send CSF for cell count and differential, protein and glucose levels, and a Gram's stain and bacterial culture. Consider additional CSF studies for immunocompromised patients or if a specific CNS infection is suspected based on the initial CSF testing results. HSV or enterovirus PCR, bacterial antigen testing, or specialized fungal testing can be considered as additional testing in appropriate clinical situations. Consider other laboratory studies such  as  a  complete  blood  count  (CBC),  serum  glucose  and  electrolytes, blood  urea  nitrogen  (BUN),  and  creatinine  to  assess  for  other  potential diagnoses. A blood culture may be helpful to identify bacterial pathogens, particularly when  empiric  antibiotics  are  given  prior  to  lumbar puncture. See Table 148-1 for classically described findings in bacterial, viral, fungal, and neoplastic meningitis, although several studies have demonstrated  that  no  single  laboratory  finding  can  accurately  categorize  the cause of CSF pleocytosis in all patients. Although not typically part of an ED workup,  characteristic  findings  on  MRI  in  the  medial  temporal  and inferior frontal lobes are suggestive of HSV infection.

# ■ BrAIN ABSCESS

# Clinical Features

A brain abscess is caused by a bacterial infection of the brain parenchyma and is composed of a central purulent cavity ringed by a layer of granulation tissue and an outer fibrous capsule. Presenting signs and symptoms are often nonspecific and may include headache, neck stiffness, fever, vomiting, confusion, or changes in mental status. Patient symptoms may reflect the origin of the infection (e.g., ear or sinus pain), and symptoms may be present for 1 to 8 weeks before the diagnosis is made.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Neuroimaging is needed to make the diagnosis of a brain abscess. A CT scan of the head without contrast may identify abnormalities or evidence of surrounding edema, but a CT scan with contrast is more likely to accurately identify an abscess with thin rings of enhancement surrounding a

respiratory  sources.  Most  of  these  infections  occur  in  the  thoracic  and lumbar spine.

The classic  triad  of  back  pain,  fever,  and  neurological  symptoms  is present in a minority of patients, although back pain itself is very common and found in 70% to 90% of cases. Fever is also a common symptom. The typical course of an untreated epidural abscess occurs in four stages:  (1)  back  pain,  fever,  and  localized  spinal  tenderness;  (2)  spinal irritation with radicular pain, hyperreflexia, and nuchal rigidity; (3) fecal or  urinary  incontinence  plus  focal  neurological  deficits;  and  (4)  motor paralysis of the lower extremities.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Assess patient's epidural abscess risk factors such as immunocompromised states, intravenous drug abuse, spinal surgery, or recent procedures such as lumbar puncture or epidural anesthesia. Physical examination findings may include  midline  spine  tenderness  to  palpation  or  percussion.  Assess  for neurologic findings and findings concerning for cauda equina syndrome. For  example,  decreased  rectal  tone  has  a  reported  sensitivity  of  60%  to 80%, while decreased perineal sensation has a sensitivity of 75%.

This challenging diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific presenting symptoms and the rarity of this condition. Laboratory studies such as CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein may be helpful. Blood cultures are positive in 40% of cases and can be helpful to guide treatment after admission to the hospital. Neuroimaging with a gadolinium MRI is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis, although a CT scan with myelography may be helpful if an MRI is not possible.

# ■ INFECTIONS AND INFLAMMATION

# Preseptal (Periorbital) and Postseptal (Orbital) Cellulitis

Preseptal cellulitis is an infection of the periorbital tissues, whereas postseptal  cellulitis  involves  the  orbit.  Both  conditions  primarily  present  in children < 10 years old. They may present nearly identically with typical symptoms of excessive tearing, erythema, warmth, tenderness to palpation of the lids, and periorbital tissue. In preseptal cellulitis, there is NO eye involvement .  That  is,  visual  acuity,  pupillary  responses,  and  eye  appearance are normal, and there is no pain with extraocular movements . If any of these characteristics are present, or if there is concern about postseptal involvement, obtain a CT scan with contrast of the orbit (or MRI) to rule out  orbital  involvement.  Preseptal  cellulitis  in  nontoxic  patients  may  be treated  as  an  outpatient  with amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid 20  mg/kg  PO divided every 12 hours; 500 mg PO three times daily in adults or a firstgeneration cephalosporin, hot packs, and with 24 to 48 hours ophthalmology  follow-up.  In  cases  of  preseptal  cellulitis  that  are  severe  or  involve high-risk  patients  (e.g.,  children < 5  years  or  patients  with  significant comorbidities) or in any case of postseptal cellulitis, obtain an emergent ophthalmology  consultation for  admission  for  intravenous  antibiotics. Empiric therapy should begin with cefuroxime 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours or ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg every 12 hours, or ampicillin-sulbactam 50 mg/ kg  IV  every  6  hours,  with  IV  vancomycin  added  if  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected. Use fluoroquinolones PLUS metronidazole or clindamycin in penicillin allergic adults.

# Stye (External Hordeolum) and Chalazion

A stye is an acute infection of an oil gland at the lash line that appears as a pustule at the lid margin . A chalazion is an acute or chronic inflammation of the eyelid secondary to meibomian gland blockage in the tarsal plate. When it is acute, a chalazion may be painful, but is usually painless when chronic. A stye or acute chalazion is treated with warm, wet compresses four times daily and with erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment twice

daily for 7 to 10 days. Refer persistent or recurrent lesions to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment.

# Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Bacterial  conjunctivitis  presents  as  eyelash  matting,  mild  to  moderate mucopurulent  discharge,  and  conjunctival  inflammation.  Fluorescein staining  of  the  cornea  should  be  performed  in  patients  with  suspected conjunctivitis  to  avoid  missing  abrasions,  ulcers,  and  dendritic  lesions. Prescribe topical antibiotics for  5  to  7  days (Table 149-1). Quinolones (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin ophthalmic) may be used in children due to limited systemic absorption. Avoid gentamicin due to high incidence of ocular irritation. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are considerations in children; therefore, if erythromycin ointment is being used and is ineffective, a change in antibiotics should be initiated. Contact lens wearers should receive topical antibiotic coverage for Pseudomonas ,

such as ciprofloxacin or tobramycin . The lens should be discarded and not replaced until the infection has completely resolved.

A  severe  purulent  discharge  with  a  hyperacute  onset  (within  12  to 24 hours) should prompt an emergent ophthalmology consultation for an aggressive workup for possible gonococcal conjunctivitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections may be confirmed by Gram stain (gram-negative intracellular  diplococci).  Emergency  department  (ED)  care  for N.  gonorrhoeae infections  include  culture,  parenteral ceftriaxone, and saline  solution irrigation to remove the discharge.

If  bacterial  conjunctivitis  is  present  in  a  neonate,  suspect  a  sexually transmitted disease (STD) etiology. These are sight-threatening conditions which can be difficult to diagnose, and an emergent ophthalmology evaluation in the ED is warranted. If gonorrhea is suspected, an inpatient workup for disseminated disease is indicated. If chlamydia is suspected, then associated pneumonia must be ruled out prior to discharge. Herpes conjunctivitis is also a possibility. (See Herpes Simplex Virus .)

# Viral Conjunctivitis

Viral conjunctivitis presents as watery discharge, chemosis, and conjunctival inflammation. It is often associated with viral respiratory symptoms and occasionally preauricular lymphadenopathy. Fluorescein staining should be done as in bacterial conjunctivitis, specifically in this case to rule out dendritic  lesions.  Treatment  consists  of  cool  compresses  four  times  daily, naphazoline/pheniramine 0.025%/0.3%  one  drop  three  times  daily,  as needed, for conjunctival congestion or itching, artificial tears five or six times a day, and ophthalmology follow-up in 7 to 14 days. If a clear distinction between viral and bacterial etiologies cannot be made, consideration

--- Page 836 ---

816 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

should be made to add topical antibiotics (Table 149-1) until reexamination by  an  ophthalmologist;  however, routine  use  of  antibiotics  is  discouraged .  All  the  cases  of  viral  conjunctivitis  are  extremely  contagious  and appropriate transmission precautions must be taken.

# allergic Conjunctivitis

Allergic conjunctivitis presents as pruritus, watery discharge, and chemosis with  a  history  of  allergies.  There  should  be  no  lesions  with  fluorescein staining and no preauricular nodes. Conjunctival papillae are seen on slit lamp examination. Treatment consists of elimination of the inciting agent, cool compresses four times daily, artificial tears five or six times daily, and naphazoline/pheniramine 0.025%/0.3% one drop four times daily. Severe cases may require a mild topical steroid, but steroids should be only administered in consultation with an ophthalmologist.

# Herpes Simplex Virus

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection may involve the eyelids, conjunctiva, or cornea. Corneal lesions stain brightly with fluorescein and can appear as a  classic  'dendrite'  (a  linear  branching,  epithelial  defect  with  terminal bulbs) or as a 'geographic ulcer' (an amoeba-like ulceration with dendrites at the edges) (Figure 149-1), but the presentation can be very variable and subtle.  Corneal  sensation  can  be  decreased  and  should  be  checked.  It  is essential  that  HSV  infection  should  not  be  confused  with  conjunctivitis, hence the necessity of a slit lamp fluorescein examination in these patients. If  HSV  infection  is  suspected,  obtain  an ophthalmology consult .  If  the outbreak involves only the eyelids, acyclovir 800 mg PO five times daily

--- Page 837 ---

CHAPTER 149: Eye Emergencies

817

for 7 to 10 days should be prescribed. If the conjunctiva is involved, prescribe trifluorothymidine 1% drops nine times daily. In addition, erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment twice daily and warm soaks three times daily  to  skin  lesions  can  help  prevent  secondary  bacterial  infections.  If corneal or deeper structure involvement is present, then antibiotic choice should be determined by the consulting ophthalmologist. Topical steroids are to be strictly avoided in all cases of HSV infection . Close follow-up from the ED and strong precautions are essential.

When conjunctivitis is present in the neonate, especially with mucocutaneous  lesions,  HSV  also  should  be  suspected,  even  in  the  absence  of maternal  infection.  As  with  other  causes  of  neonatal  conjunctivitis,  an emergent  ophthalmology  consult  at  the  bedside  is  warranted.  If  HSV  is diagnosed or strongly suspected, treat with acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours and topical antivirals (1% trifluridine, 0.1% iododeoxyuridine, or 3% vidarabine). Further workup for sepsis is indicated. Steroid drops should not be given.

# Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus

Shingles  in  a  trigeminal  distribution  with  ocular  involvement  is  termed herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). The presence or eventual development of HZO should be suspected in any patient whose shingles involve the tip of the nose (Hutchinson's sign). Photophobia and pain secondary to iritis are often present. Slit lamp examination may show a 'pseudodendrite,' a poorly staining  mucus plaque without epithelial erosion. Acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day, famciclovir 500 mg three times daily, or valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days should be prescribed if the skin lesions have been present less than 7 days. In addition, erythromycin 2%  ointment  and  warm  compresses  should  be  applied  to  skin lesions.  Ocular  involvement  requires erythromycin 0.5%  ophthalmic ointment to the eye twice daily. For comfort, oral opioid analgesia, cycloplegic agents ( cyclopentolate 1% one drop three times daily), and cool compresses are helpful. If iritis is present, prednisolone acetate 1% one drop every 1 to 6 hours is effective. However, because topical steroid use in patients with herpes simplex keratoconjunctivitis may be catastrophic, it is imperative that there should be no corneal lesions present on slit lamp examination before topical steroids are used. In severe cases, admission and acyclovir IV may be required. For this reason, all the cases of suspected  HZO require ophthalmology consultation .  All  patients  younger than 40 years with HZO should undergo an outpatient medical evaluation for a possible immunocompromised state.

# Corneal ulcer

A corneal ulcer is a serious infection of the corneal stroma caused by bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , viruses including herpes simplex and varicella zoster, and fungi. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for fungal or viral etiologies. It is commonly associated with trauma, especially in  patients  who  use  extended-wear  contact  lenses  and  those  who  wear lenses while sleeping. Ulcers may cause pain, redness, tearing, photophobia,  and  blurry  vision.  Slit  lamp  examination  shows  a  staining  corneal defect  with  a  surrounding  white  hazy  infiltrate,  and  associated  iritis  and

--- Page 838 ---

818

SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

sometimes  a  hypopyon.  Topical ofloxacin 0.3%  or ciprofloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution should be administered, one drop in the affected eye each hour. Antifungal or antiviral antibiotics may be given to immunocompromised patients in consultation with an ophthalmologist. Topical cycloplegics, such as cyclopentolate 1% one drop three times daily, aid in pain relief. Eye patching is strictly contraindicated because of the risk of worsening  a  potential Pseudomonas infection. Steroid  drops  should  be avoided unless  an  ophthalmologist  advises  administration.  It  would  be ideal for the patient to be seen by an ophthalmologist in the ED in order to culture the ulcer prior to starting antibiotics. However, if this is not possible, they should see the patient within 12 to 24 hours.

# iritis

Iritis is inflammation of the anterior uveal tract (iris and ciliary body) that has many causes (Table 149-2). It presents with red eye, photophobia, and decreased vision. A hallmark physical examination sign is consensual pain (pain in the affected eye when light is shined in the nonaffected eye). Slit lamp  examination  reveals  WBCs  in  the  anterior  chamber,  usually  with associated flare, and a hypopyon can eventually occur. Perform an exam with  fluorescein  dye  to  detect  corneal  abrasions,  ulcers,  or  dendritic lesions,  and  measure intraocular pressure (IOP), which can be elevated. Once iritis is diagnosed, undertake an appropriate ED workup for a systemic  etiology  and  treat  them,  if  found.  Symptomatic  treatment  with tropicamide (Table  149-1)  is  helpful.  Ophthalmology  consultation  is appropriate  with  follow-up  in  24  to  48  hours.  Steroid  drops  can  be  of value, but should only be given if directed by the ophthalmologist.

# Endophthalmitis

Endophthalmitis is an infection involving the deep structures of the globe. Patients present with pain and visual loss. It is often seen as a complication of  globe  violation  either  from  trauma  or  ocular  surgery.  Hematologic spread  is  possible.  Pathogens  include Staphylococcus,  Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Bacillus species. Emergency ophthalmology consultation

and admission are warranted. Treatment may include vitreous aspiration, vitrectomy, intraocular and systemic antibiotics, and steroids.

# ■ TrAUMA

# Subconjunctival Hemorrhage

This injury is a disruption of conjunctival blood vessels, typically secondary to trauma, sneezing, or the Valsalva maneuver. It requires no treatment and usually resolves within 2 weeks. Its primary clinical importance rests in the fact that it can be a sign of significant eye injury when due to trauma, and recurrent episodes should prompt an evaluation for a coagulopathy.

# Corneal abrasion and ultraviolet Keratitis

Traumatic  abrasions  may  cause  superficial  or  deep  epithelial  defects resulting in tearing, photophobia, blepharospasm, and pain. Administration of a topical anesthetic often will facilitate the examination. Proparacaine 0.5% is preferred over tetracaine because it causes less pain upon administration  and  provides  comparable  anesthesia. A  corneal  abrasion will  glow  green  during  a  fluorescein  stain  examination  when  using  the cobalt blue light on the slit lamp. A careful search for an ocular foreign body (including upper lid eversion) must be done in the presence of an abrasion, especially when they are multiple and linear. Once the diagnosis of a simple abrasion is made, prescribe ketorolac ophthalmic solution one drop four times a day for pain control.  For  severe  pain  with  large abrasions, opioid  analgesia and/or  a cycloplegic (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% one drop three times a day) may be considered. Abrasions are treated with topical  antibiotics (Table  149-1).  Most  patients  are  treated  with erythromycin ointment ; however, abrasions associated with contact lens wear  should  be  treated  with  antipseudomonal  topical  antibiotics  (e.g., ciprofloxacin,  ofloxacin ,  or tobramycin ).  Patching  corneal  abrasions traditionally has been recommended; however, excellent patient comfort can be achieved without it. More importantly, patching does not hasten the healing of abrasions and can greatly harm the patient if lesions prone to  infection (e.g., contact lens abrasions or corneal ulcers) are patched. Prescribing  topical  anesthetics  is  absolutely  contraindicated  because repeated  use  may  cause  catastrophic  corneal  damage.  All  abrasions should be reexamined in 24 to 48 hours by an ophthalmologist, with those that are large or involve the visual axis seen sooner.

Exposure  to  ultraviolet  light  from  welding  ('arc  welder's  keratitis'), tanning beds, or prolonged sun exposure (especially when reflected off ice and snow-covered slopes at high altitude) can cause a diffuse burn to the cornea  which  appears  as  diffuse  punctate  corneal  abrasions  with  edema. Severe pain and photophobia develop 6 to 12 hours after exposure. Treatment is similar to corneal abrasions, but more aggressive pain control is sometimes necessary. Healing typically occurs in 2 to 3 days.

# Corneal Foreign Bodies

Superficial  foreign  bodies  of  the  cornea  are  removed  under  slit  lamp microscopy with a 25-guage needle, an eye spud, or an ophthalmic burr. Topical  anesthesia  (e.g., proparacaine  0.5% )  is  used  and  can  also  be

--- Page 840 ---

820

SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

instilled in the unaffected eye to depress reflex blinking. For obvious reasons,  this  procedure  should  be  attempted  only  in  a  sober,  cooperative patient. Any corneal foreign body deep within the corneal stroma or in the central  visual  axis  should  be  removed  by  an  ophthalmologist.  Metallic foreign bodies often leave an epithelial 'rust ring' that may be removed immediately with an eye  burr ;  however,  it  is  often  easier  to  remove  in 24 to 48 hours. A corneal abrasion will result from foreign body removal and  is  treated  in  the  standard  manner  ( cycloplegics,  antibiotics ).  All patients  should  be  referred  to  an  ophthalmologist  within  24  hours.  The presence of either gross or micro hyphema should prompt further investigation  for  possible  globe  perforation.  (See Penetrating  Trauma  or Ruptured Globe. )

# lid lacerations

Many small superficial lacerations to the eye lids can be repaired by emergency physicians; however, eyelid lacerations that involve the lid margin, those within 6 to 8 mm of the medial canthus or involving the lacrimal duct or sac, those involving the inner surface of the lid, wounds associated with ptosis,  and  those  involving  the  tarsal  plate  or  levator  palpebrae  muscle, need repair by an oculoplastic surgeon. Due to a high chance of morbidity, lid  margin  lacerations > 1  mm  require  closure  by  an  ophthalmologist, whereas those < 1 mm can heal spontaneously. For medial lid lacerations, injury to the nasolacrimal duct system should be considered. Fluorescein instilled into the tear layer that appears in an adjacent laceration confirms the injury. Nasolacrimal duct injuries, upper lid lacerations that involve the levator  mechanism,  and  all  through-and-through  lid  lacerations  must  be repaired in the operating room. All full-thickness lid lacerations should be further investigated to rule out an associated corneal laceration and globe rupture . If an ophthalmologist is not immediately available to evaluate a high-risk lid laceration, it is not unreasonable to prescribe cephalexin 500 mg PO four times daily, erythromycin 2% ointment four times daily, and gentle cold compresses with referral for ophthalmic evaluation within 24 hours, as long as any sight-threatening lesions have been excluded.

# Blunt Eye Trauma

An eye speculum (or two bent paper clips) may be useful in visualization of the bluntly injured eye, but care should be taken to avoid any pressure on the globe. Once the eye is visualized, the integrity of the globe and visual acuity must be assessed immediately. Red flag signs such as an abnormal anterior chamber depth , an irregular pupil , or blindness indicate a ruptured globe until proven otherwise, and an emergent ophthalmology referral is indicated. An eye shield should be placed as soon as a globe injury is suspected to protect against further injury. If there are no hard signs of globe  rupture,  a  complete  eye  exam,  including  slit  lamp  examination, should be performed to check for blowout fracture, corneal abrasions, lacerations, foreign bodies, hyphema, pupillary injury, iritis, and lens dislocation. Postseptal hemorrhage can also occur with blunt trauma, especially in  those  on  anticoagulants.  Pain,  proptosis,  impaired  extraocular  movements,  decreased  vision,  possible  afferent  pupillary  defect  (APD),  and elevated  IOP  are  the  hallmarks  of  this  condition.  Orbital  compartment

--- Page 841 ---

CHAPTER 149: Eye Emergencies

821

syndrome  may  result  and  may  require  a  lateral  canthotomy  to  alleviate sight-threatening increased IOP. A CT of the orbit is the ED test of choice to confirm the presence of ruptured globe, intraocular foreign body, postseptal hemorrhage, and orbital fractures, but sensitivity can be as low as 70%  for  occult  globe  injury;  therefore,  the  involvement  of  an ophthalmologist is  mandatory  for  possible  surgical  exploration  in  high-risk  or suspicious cases. Traumatic iritis in the absence of a corneal injury can be treated  with prednisolone  acetate 1%  one  drop  every  6  hours  and cyclopentolate 1% one drop every 8 hours. The care of the blunt trauma eye patient should be discussed with an ophthalmologist, and the patient should follow-up with the ophthalmologist within 48 hours even if no significant injuries are initially found.

# Hyphema

A hyphema is the presence of blood in the anterior chamber and often is a sign of significant trauma. It also can occur spontaneously in sickle cell patients and in patients with coagulopathies. Sight-threatening increases in IOP can occur. In all hyphemas, emergent evaluation by an ophthalmologist is indicated. The patient should be placed either fully upright or head-of-bead (HOB) to 30° to 45° to allow the blood to settle inferiorly, which allows faster improvement of vision and facilitates assessment of the hyphema size and posterior pole. A protective eye shield should be in place,  except  during  examination  and  medication  administration.  After ruptured globe is excluded, the patient should be evaluated for other eye injuries and treated appropriately. Because of the 30% risk of rebleed in 3 to 5 days and the potential necessity of surgical intervention, any disposition  decisions  should  be  made  by  an  ophthalmologist  at  the  bedside, regardless of the size of the hyphema.

# Orbital Blowout Fractures

Orbital blowout fractures commonly involve the inferior wall and medial wall.  The  resultant  entrapment  of  the  inferior  rectus  muscle  may  cause restriction of movement, with a resultant diplopia on upward gaze. Other signs include paresthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve and subcutaneous  emphysema,  particularly  when  sneezing  or  blowing  the nose. If a blowout fracture is suspected, CT of the orbit with 1.5-mm cuts should be performed, with additional studies as indicated. Because of the high  incidence  of  associated  ocular  trauma  (33%),  make  an  aggressive effort to exclude associated injuries. Antibiotic prophylaxis with cephalexin 250 to 500 mg PO four times daily for 10 days is recommended due to sinus involvement. Refer all isolated blowout fractures, with or without entrapment, to an ophthalmologist for a formal dilated exam to rule out retinal injury.

# Penetrating Trauma or ruptured globe

Globe penetration or rupture is a catastrophic injury that must be identified  immediately.  Suggestive  findings  include  a  severe  subconjunctival hemorrhage,  shallow  or  deep  anterior  chamber  as  compared  with  the other  eye,  hyphema,  teardrop-shaped  pupil,  limitation  of  extraocular motility, extrusion of globe contents, or a significant reduction in visual

--- Page 842 ---

822

SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

acuity. However, it is important to note that penetrating injury from small foreign  bodies  can  present  with  a  nearly  normal  exam .  Therefore, strongly suspect a penetrating injury when the history of a high-speed foreign body (e.g., the patient was hammering or grinding without eye protection)  or  a  penetrating  injury  in  proximity  of  the  orbit  is  present.  A bright-green  streaming  appearance  to  fluorescein  instilled  into  the  tear layer  (Seidel  test)  is  pathognomonic,  although  it  may  be  absent  if  the wound  has  sealed.  Therefore, the  presence  of  an  abrasion  with  this mechanism does not rule out a penetrating injury . Once a globe injury is suspected, any further manipulation or examination of the eye must be avoided.  In  such  cases, place  a  protective  eye  shield  immediately and place the patient upright and keep them NPO. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics  with  an  antiemetic  to  prevent  increased  IOP  from  vomiting. Update tetanus status if necessary. In unclear cases, it may be necessary to perform a CT of the orbit to confirm the presence of an orbital foreign body or a ruptured globe. However, as noted above, CT sensitivity can be low for occult globe injury; therefore, an ophthalmologist should be called immediately if a globe rupture or a penetrating injury is strongly suspected .

# Chemical Ocular injury

Acid and alkali burns are managed in a similar manner. The eye should be flushed immediately at the scene and sterile normal saline or Ringer lactate irrigation solution should be continued in the ED immediately upon arrival  (even  before  visual  acuities  or  patient  registration)  until  the  pH remains at or near 7.4. A topical anesthetic and a Morgan lens are used in this procedure. After the first 2 L of irrigation, the pH may be checked in the lower cul-de-sac with litmus paper or the pH square on a urine dipstick 5 to 10 minutes after suspending irrigation (to allow time for equilibration). Irrigation should be continued until a normal pH can be maintained at least 30 minutes after cessation . Irrigation volumes needed to reach normal pH may exceed 8 to 10 L, depending on the caustic substance. A persistently abnormal pH should prompt removal of any crystallized particles in the fornices with a moistened cotton-tipped applicator. Once the pH is normal, the fornices  should  be  inspected  and  the  eyelids  everted  to  look  for  any  residual particles and reswept with a moistened cotton-tipped applicator to remove them and any necrotic conjunctiva. The pH should be rechecked every 10 minutes for 30 minutes to make sure that no additional corrosive is leaching out from the tissues. A thorough slit lamp examination, with lid eversion, should be done to assess the amount of damage and any associated injuries. IOP should be measured because it can become elevated with significant burns. A cycloplegic ( cyclopentolate 1%) one drop three times daily will alleviate  ciliary  spasm,  and erythromycin 0.5%  ophthalmic  ointment applied every 1 to 2 hours while awake should be prescribed. Most patients will require opioid pain medications . Update tetanus status if necessary. If there are signs of a severe injury, such as a pronounced chemosis, conjunctival  blanching,  epithelial  defect,  corneal  edema  or  opacification,  or increased IOP, the patient should be seen in the ED by an ophthalmologist. Certain  specialized  burns,  such  as  those  due  to  hydrofluoric  acid,  lye,  or concrete,  also  should  be  seen  by  an  ophthalmologist  immediately.  Otherwise, a telephone consult with the ophthalmologist to arrange close followup within 24 hours should be obtained for all ocular burns.

# Cyanoacrylate (Super glue or Crazy glue) Exposure

Cyanoacrylate glue easily adheres to the eyelids and corneal surface. Its primary morbidity stems from corneal injuries from the hard particles that form. Initial manual removal is facilitated by heavy application of erythromycin 0.5%  ophthalmic  ointment,  with  special  care  to  avoid  damaging underlying structures. After the easily removable pieces are removed, the patient  should  be  discharged  with erythromycin 0.5%  ophthalmic  ointment to be applied five times a day to soften the remaining glue. Complete removal of the residual glue can be accomplished by the ophthalmologist at a follow-up visit within 24 hours. Serious injury from this exposure is rare.

# ■ ACUTE VISUAL rEDUCTION Or LOSS

# acute angle Closure glaucoma

Acute angle closure glaucoma classically presents with sudden onset of severe  eye  pain  and/or  headache,  cloudy  vision,  colored  halos  around lights,  and  vomiting.  Acute  attacks  in  patients  can  be  precipitated  in movie theaters, while reading, and after ill-advised use of dilatory agents or inhaled anticholinergics or cocaine. Physical examination may reveal conjunctival  injection,  corneal  clouding,  a  fixed  mid-dilated  pupil,  and increased IOP of 40 to 70 mm Hg (normal range, 10 to 20 mm Hg). All cases require immediate ophthalmologic consultation . Simultaneous to the ophthalmology consult, attempts to decrease the IOP (Table 149-3) should begin immediately. Place the patient supine. Controlled comparative efficacy data are lacking for medical treatment, so treatment recommendations vary. However, in general, medications to administer include timolol 0.5%, apraclonidine 1.0%, and PO acetazolamide 500 mg in the absence of contraindications (acetazolamide is contraindicated in sickle cell and sulfa allergic patients). If IOP is greater than 50 mm Hg, if vision loss is severe, or if the patient cannot tolerate PO then IV acetazolamide should be given instead. If IOP remains ≥ 40 mm Hg 30 minutes after treatment has begun, mannitol should be considered. Pilocarpine 1% to 2% one drop every 15 minutes for two doses in the affected eye and pilocarpine 0.5% one drop in the contralateral eye may be given once the IOP

is below 40 mm Hg, although some experts recommend giving pilocarpine immediately upon diagnosis. Symptoms of pain and nausea should be treated, and the IOP should be monitored hourly. Subsequent treatment decisions and disposition of the patient should be made by an ophthalmologist at the bedside.

# Optic Neuritis

Optic  neuritis  (ON)  refers  to  inflammation  at  any  point  along  the  optic nerve  and  presents  with  acute  vision  loss,  with  a  particular  reduction  in color  vision.  It  is  strongly  associated  with  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  but many other etiologies exist (e.g., syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis). It is often painless, but can sometimes be painful, especially with extraocular movements. The red desaturation test may be helpful in identifying optic neuropathies. This test is performed by having the patient look with one eye at a time at a dark red object. The affected eye often will see a red object as pink or lighter red. An APD often can be detected, and visual field defects may be present. In anterior ON, the optic disc appears swollen (papillitis); there  are  no  ophthalmoscopic  findings  in  retrobulbar  cases. An  ophthalmologist should direct evaluation and treatment. IV steroids, followed by oral steroids, have been shown to accelerate visual recovery and temporarily  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  MS,  but  oral  steroids  alone  actually increase  the  rate  of  ON  reoccurrence.  A  new  diagnosis  of  ON  should prompt a workup for MS and other causes.

# Central retinal artery Occlusion

Central retinal artery occlusion presents as a sudden, painless, severe monocular loss of vision, often associated with a history of amaurosis fugax. Occlusion  of  the  central  retinal  artery  will  cause  complete  visual  loss, whereas arterial branch obstruction will cause abrupt loss of a partial visual field. Classic signs include nearly complete or complete vision loss (94% with counting fingers to light perception only), a marked APD, superficial opacification or whitening of the retina in the posterior pole, and a bright red  macula  'cherry  red  spot.'  Segmentation  of  the  blood  column  in  the arterioles ('boxcarring') sometimes can be seen. A thorough evaluation to uncover  the  etiology  (commonly  an  embolic  source-carotid  or  cardiac, vasculitis, or hypercoagulable state) is required. Giant cell arteritis must be excluded. An ophthalmologist should be contacted immediately once the diagnosis is made. In the past, digital massage, acetazolamide, and timolol have  been  recommended,  but  evidence  to  support  these  interventions  is sparse. Therefore, management should be directed by an ophthalmologist per institutional protocols.

# Central retinal Vein Occlusion

Central retinal vein occlusion secondary to thrombosis causes acute, painless  monocular vision loss. Examination shows optic disc edema, cotton wool spots, and retinal hemorrhages in all four quadrants. This pattern is described as 'blood-and-thunder fundus.' APD is often present. There is no immediate  treatment  for  central  retinal  vein  occlusion,  but  predisposing drugs  (e.g.,  oral  contraceptives  or  diuretics)  should  be  discontinued. An ophthalmology consult should be obtained.

# retinal Detachment and Floaters

Patients who experience sudden change in their vision due to retinal detachment or 'floaters' in their visual field usually seek medical attention in the ED. Bilateral symptoms are almost always intracranial in origin and may be  due  to  migraine  headaches.  Monocular  symptoms  are  usually  due  to disorders in the symptomatic eye. Retinal detachment typically presents as a sudden flashes of light, floaters, or a dark veil or curtain-like defect in the patient's visual field, affecting the symptomatic eye. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by bedside ultrasonography. Urgent ophthalmologic consultation is necessary for indirect ophthalmoscopic evaluation, and potentially laser surgery. In contrast, new 'floaters' which are small particles of vitreous gel appearing to the patient as small hazy opacities need no immediate attention and can be followed up by the ophthalmologist in the office within 24 hours for a dilated exam.

# Temporal arteritis (giant Cell arteritis)

Temporal arteritis (TA) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause a painless ischemic  optic  neuropathy.  Patients  are  typically  women  older  than  50 years, often with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica. Associated symptoms include vision changes, headache, jaw claudication, scalp or temporal artery tenderness, fatigue, fever, sore throat, URI symptoms, and anorexia. Symptoms  are  usually  unilateral,  but  may  be  bilateral.  One-third  of  the cases  are  associated  with  neurologic  events  such  as  transient  ischemic attacks or stroke. An APD is frequently present, and funduscopic examination may show flame hemorrhages. A sixth cranial nerve palsy may occur. When  TA  is  suspected,  an  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR)  and C-reactive protein (CRP) should be ordered; both are elevated in TA, with the CRP the more sensitive test. Most patients with biopsy-proven cases have an ESR in the range of 70 to 110 mm/h. If TA is not treated, bilateral vision  loss  can  develop. Therefore,  if  there  is  strong  suspicion  of TA  or vision loss is present, the patient should be admitted for methylprednisolone 250 mg IV every 6 hours. For less suspicious patients with no vision loss,  discharge  home  with prednisone 80  to  100  mg/d  PO  with  close follow-up. Steroids should not be delayed pending results of a biopsy. Antiulcer medications should be prescribed to be given with systemic steroids.

# ■ OCULAr ULTrASONOGrAphY

Ocular ultrasonography can be very useful for the emergent evaluation of the eye, especially in trauma. Ultrasonography can be useful in the emergent diagnosis of retinal detachment, retrobulbar hematoma, lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, and elevated intracranial pressure. Care should be taken to avoid any pressure on the eye or eyelid if globe rupture is suspected and duration of ocular ultrasonography should be strictly limited.

# ■ FACIAL INFECTIONS

# Facial Cellulitis

Cellulitis is a soft tissue infection that involves the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Facial cellulitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus  aureus ,  with  an  increasing  predominance  of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Less commonly, cellulitis may represent an extension from a deeper facial infection. Cellulitis is characterized by erythema, edema, warmth, pain, and loss of function. Clinical features of a well-defined, palpable border are absent.

The diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) may be used to evaluate for abscess or more extensive infection. In most cases, treatment involves oral antibiotics for 7 to 14 days. Antibiotic recommendations for conditions discussed in this chapter are listed in Tables 150-1 and 150-2. Consider hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics

for patients with signs of systemic illness, failed outpatient therapy, or significant comorbidities.

# Erysipelas

Erysipelas  is  a  superficial  form  of  cellulitis,  involving  the  epidermis, upper  levels  of  the  dermis,  and  the  lymphatic  system.  Most  cases  are caused by S. pyogenes ; S. aureus is a rare etiology but is associated with bullous  disease,  trauma,  or  the  presence  of  a  foreign  body.  Clinical features include a red, raised, puffy appearance with a sharply defined, palpable border. The diagnosis is clinical. Most patients are treated with oral  antibiotics,  but  hospitalization  and  parenteral  antibiotics  should  be considered for patients who fail outpatient therapy, are immunocompromised, or exhibit evidence of systemic illness.

# Impetigo

Impetigo is a superficial epidermal infection that can be divided into bullous  and  nonbullous  presentations.  Bullous  impetigo  is  caused  by S. aureus and nonbullous impetigo is caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes . Clinical  features  of  nonbullous  impetigo  include  an  erythematous  rash with vesicles that break and form the characteristic amber crusts. Bullous impetigo presents as vesicles that enlarge to form bullae with clear yellow

--- Page 848 ---

828 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

fluid. Topical therapy with mupirocin is appropriate for simple, nonbullous disease. Oral antibiotics are prescribed for more extensive or bullous lesions.

# ■ SALIVArY GLAND DISOrDErS

# Viral Parotitis (Mumps)

Viral  parotitis  is  an  infection  that  can  present  with  unilateral  or  bilateral swelling of the parotid glands. It is most commonly caused by a paramyxovirus. Clinical features may include a prodrome of fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache followed by parotid gland swelling. The gland is tense and painful,  but  lacks  erythema  and  warmth.  Pus  cannot  be  expressed  from Stensen's duct.

The  diagnosis  is  clinical  and  treatment  is  supportive.  Swelling  may persist for 5 days. The patient is contagious for approximately 9 days after the  onset  of  parotid  swelling.  Extrasalivary  gland  involvement  includes orchitis in 20% to 30% of males and oophoritis in 5% of females. Other systemic  complications  include  pancreatitis,  aseptic  meningitis,  hearing loss,  myocarditis,  arthritis,  hemolytic  anemia,  and  thrombocytopenia. Consider hospitalization for patients with systemic complications.

# Suppurative Parotitis

Suppurative parotitis is a serious bacterial infection that occurs in patients with diminished salivary flow. Retrograde transmission of bacteria leads to infection. Factors that lead to decreased salivary flow include recent anesthesia, dehydration, prematurity, advanced age, medications (e.g., diuretics, β -blockers, antihistamines, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants), and  certain  disorders  (Sjögren's  syndrome,  diabetes,  hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, and human immunodeficiency virus). Clinical features may include fever, trismus, erythema, and pain over the parotid gland. Pus may be expressed from Stensen's duct.

The  diagnosis  is  clinical.  Ultrasound  or  CT  may  be  ordered  if  an abscess  is  suspected.  Treatment  should  optimize  salivary  flow  by  using sialogogues such as lemon drops and stopping any medications that cause dry mouth. Oral antibiotics are appropriate for those tolerating oral intake and are without trismus. Hospitalization is appropriate for patients with signs  of  systemic  illness,  immunocompromise,  inability  to  tolerate  oral intake, or those that have failed outpatient therapy. Close follow-up should be arranged.

# Sialolithiasis

Sialolithiasis  is  the  development  of  stones  in  a  stagnant  salivary  duct. Eighty percent of stones occur in the submandibular duct. Sialolithiasis is  typically  unilateral  and  presents  with  pain,  swelling,  and  tenderness that may be exacerbated with eating. The diagnosis is clinical. A stone may  be  palpated  within  the  duct  and  the  gland  is  firm.  Treatment includes  analgesics,  massage,  sialogogues  such  as  lemon  drops,  and antibiotics if a concurrent infection is suspected. Palpable stones may be milked from the duct. Persistent retained calculi may be removed by an otolaryngologist.

--- Page 849 ---

CHAPTER 150: Face and Jaw Emergencies 829

# Masticator Space abscess

The masticator space consists of potential spaces bounded by the muscles of mastication. Infection is usually polymicrobial and is commonly associated with an odontogenic source. Clinical features include facial swelling, pain, erythema, and trismus. In advanced cases, signs of sepsis may be present. The diagnosis is made with contrast-enhanced CT scan. Because  the  masticator  spaces  ultimately  communicate  with  tissue planes that extend into the mediastinum, early treatment is imperative. ED treatment includes stabilization, antibiotics, otolaryngology consult, and hospitalization.

# ■ MANDIBLE DISOrDErS

# Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) combines a hinge and a gliding action. Anatomic derangements or systemic disease can cause dysfunction of this joint. Clinical features include pain over the muscles of mastication or in the  region  of  the TMJ  and  there  may  be  a  limited  range  of  motion. The diagnosis is usually clinical. For patients with acute trauma, imaging with CT  or  panoramic  x-ray  may  be  warranted.  Treatment  for  nontraumatic conditions consists of analgesics, soft diet, and referral to a dental specialist. An oral and maxillofacial surgeon manages fractures.

# Trigeminal Neuralgia

Trigeminal neuralgia presents with facial pain in the distribution of the fifth cranial  nerve.  It  is  characterized  by  paroxysms  of  severe  pain  lasting seconds, with normal findings on physical exam. Carbamazepine , starting at  100  mg  PO  twice  a  day  and  then  increasing  dosage  as  needed,  is  an effective treatment.

# bell's Palsy

Bell's  palsy  is  characterized  by  an  acute  onset  of  unilateral  upper  and lower facial paralysis. A detailed neurologic exam is useful in ruling out other conditions, such as stroke. Sparing of the forehead muscles on the affected side is suggestive of a central process. Examine the ear for presence of cranial herpes zoster. Treatment with steroids within the first 72 hours of symptom onset is thought to improve chances of a full recovery. The recommended dosing is 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalent, up to 60 mg/d, for 6 days followed by a 10-day taper. The use of antivirals is controversial and benefit modest at best. Ocular lubricants should be used to prevent dry eyes.

# Dislocation of the Mandible

The mandible can be dislocated in an anterior, posterior, lateral, or superior position. Anterior dislocation is the most common. Patients with an acute jaw dislocation present with pain, difficulty swallowing, and malocclusion. In anterior dislocations, a history of extreme mouth opening is typical and there is difficulty with jaw movement. Other dislocations usually require significant trauma.

--- Page 850 ---

830

SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

The  diagnosis  of  atraumatic  anterior  dislocations  is  clinical.  Imaging with panoramic x-ray or CT is indicated for all other dislocations. Treatment of anterior dislocations without fracture is closed reduction and this is made  easier  with  analgesia,  muscle  relaxants,  or  procedural  sedation. Reduction is most commonly done in a seated patient. The thumbs are padded with gauze, placed over the molars, and pressure is applied downward and backward. Patients with open or nonreducible dislocations, fractures, or nerve injury should be referred emergently to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. After  reduction,  patients  should  be  instructed  to  not  open  their mouth more than 2 cm for 2 weeks. Elective referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is recommended.

# ■ OTOLOGIC EMERGENCIES

# Otitis Externa

Otitis externa, or 'swimmer's ear,' is characterized by pruritus, pain, and tenderness of the external ear. Erythema and edema of the external auditory canal, otorrhea, crusting, and hearing impairment may also be present. Pain is elicited with movement of the pinna or tragus. Risk factors for development of otitis externa include swimming, trauma of the external canal, and any process that elevates the pH of the canal.

The most common organisms implicated in otitis externa are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and Proteus species , and Staphylococcus aureus , with P. aeruginosa being the most common organism causing malignant otitis externa. Otomycosis, or fungal otitis externa, is found in tropical climates and in the immunocompromised or subsequent to long-term antibiotic therapy. Aspergillus and Candida are the most common fungal pathogens.

The treatment of otitis externa includes analgesics, cleaning the external auditory canal, acidifying agents, topical antimicrobials, and occasionally topical steroid preparations. Cleansing can be performed with irrigation of the canal using hydrogen peroxide in a 1:1 dilution with warm saline or water or with gentle suction under visualization. Ofloxacin otic  5  drops two times daily, acetic acid/hydrocortisone otic 5 drops three times daily (do not use with perforated TM), and ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone otic 3 drops two times daily are commonly used for 7 days to treat otitis externa. If significant swelling of the external canal is present, a wick or piece of gauze may be inserted into the canal to allow passage of topical medications. Oral antibiotics are not indicated as first-line agents unless fever or periauricular spread is present.

Malignant otitis externa is a potentially life-threatening infection of the external auditory canal with variable extension to the skull base (osteomyelitis). Historically, greater than 90% of cases were caused by Pseudomonas  aeruginosa ;  however,  15%  are  now  caused  by  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus (MRSA).  Elderly,  diabetic,  and  immunocompromised patients are most commonly affected. Diagnosis of malignant otitis externa requires a high index of suspicion. Computed tomography (CT) is necessary to determine the extent and stage of the disease. Emergent otolaryngology (ENT) consultation, tobramycin 2 mg/kg IV and piperacillin 3.375 to 4.5 g IV, or ceftriaxone 1 g IV, or ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV, and admission to the hospital are needed.

# Otitis Media

The incidence and prevalence of otitis media (OM) peak in the preschool years and decline with advancing age. The most common bacterial pathogens in acute OM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae ,

831

--- Page 852 ---

832 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

and Moraxella catarrhalis . The predominant organisms involved in chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,  and anaerobic bacteria.

Patients with OM present with otalgia, with or without fever; occasionally, hearing loss and otorrhea are present. The tympanic membrane (TM) may be retracted or bulging and will have impaired mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. The TM may appear red as a result of inflammation or may be yellow or white due to middle-ear secretions. Additionally, assessment of the facial nerve should be performed.

In  the  pediatric  population  the  'wait-and-see'  method  can  be  used; however, this treatment plan has not been studied in adults. For adults, a 10-day course of amoxicillin 250 to 500 mg PO three times daily for 7 to 10 days is the preferred initial treatment for OM. Alternative agents include azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for 1 day then 250 mg PO daily for 4 days, or cefuroxime 500  mg  PO  two  times  daily  for  10  days. Cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanate may  be  given  for  OM  unresponsive  to  first-line therapy after 72 hours. Antibiotic coverage should be extended to 3 weeks for  patients  with  OM  with  effusion. Analgesics  should  be  prescribed  for patients with any degree of pain. Patients should follow-up with a primary care physician for reexamination and to assess the effectiveness of therapy.

Complications of OM include TM perforation, conductive hearing loss, acute serous labyrinthitis, facial nerve paralysis, acute mastoiditis, lateral sinus thrombosis, cholesteatoma, and intracranial complications. TM perforation and conductive hearing loss are most often self-limiting and often require no specific intervention. Facial nerve paralysis is uncommon but requires emergent ENT consultation.

# Acute Mastoiditis

Acute mastoiditis occurs as infection spreads from the middle ear to the mastoid  air  cells.  Patients  present  with  otalgia,  fever,  and  postauricular erythema, swelling, and tenderness. Protrusion of the auricle with obliteration of the postauricular crease may be present. CT will delineate the extent of bony involvement. Emergent ENT consultation, vancomycin 1 to 2 g IV or ceftriaxone 1 g IV, and admission to the hospital are necessary. Surgical drainage ultimately may be required.

# Lateral Sinus Thrombosis

This condition arises from extension of infection and inflammation into the lateral and sigmoid sinuses. Headache is common and papilledema, sixth nerve palsy, and vertigo may be present. Diagnosis may be made with CT, although magnetic resonance imaging or angiography is more sensitive and may be necessary. Therapy consists of emergent ENT consultation, combination therapy with nafcillin 2 g IV , ceftriaxone 1 g IV , and metronidazole 500 mg IV, and hospital admission.

# Bullous Myringitis

Bullous myringitis is a painful condition of the ear characterized by bulla on the TM and deep external auditory canal (EAC). Numerous pathogens have  been  implicated  including  viruses, Mycoplasma  pneumoniae ,  and Chlamydia psittaci .  The  diagnosis  is  made  by  clinical  examination.  The

--- Page 853 ---

CHAPTER 151: Ear, Nose, and Sinus Emergencies

833

treatment consists of pain control and warm compresses. Antibiotics can be given for concomitant OM.

# Trauma to the Ear

A hematoma can develop from any type of trauma to the ear. Improper treatment of ear hematomas can result in stimulation of the perichondrium and development of asymmetric cartilage formation. The resultant deformed auricle has been termed 'cauliflower ear.' Immediate incision and drainage of the hematoma with a compressive dressing is necessary to prevent reaccumulation of the hematoma. Antibiotic coverage for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus should be given to immunocompromised patients.

Thermal injury to the auricle may be caused by excessive heat or cold. Superficial injury of either type is treated with cleaning, topical nonsulfacontaining antibiotic ointment, and a light dressing. Frostbite is treated with rapid  rewarming  by  using  saline  soaked  gauze  at  38°C  to  40°C.  The rewarming process may be very painful and analgesics will be necessary. Any second- or third-degree burn requires immediate ENT or burn center consultation.

# Foreign Bodies in the Ear

On examination, the foreign body is usually visualized and signs of infection or TM perforation should be sought. Live insects should be immobilized with 2% lidocaine solution distilled into the ear canal before removal. Foreign bodies may be removed with forceps and direct visualization or with the aid of a hooked probe or suction catheter. Irrigation is often useful for small objects; however, organic material may absorb water and swell. ENT consultation is required for cases of foreign body with TM perforation or if the object cannot be safely removed.

# Cerumen Impaction

Cerumen impaction can cause symptoms of hearing loss, pressure, dizziness,  tinnitus  and  otalgia.  Impaction  is  often  precipitated  by  the  use  of cotton swabs in the ear canal. Cerumen scoops/loops can be used to remove the impaction. If significant amounts of cerumen are in the canal then halfstrength hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, mineral oil, or carbamide peroxide otic can be instilled in the canal to soften the cerumen and help with removal. Additionally cerumen impactions can be removed with irrigation of the EAC using body-temperature fluid via an 18ga IV catheter or ear syringe making sure that the irrigation is directed to the EAC wall not the TM. Cerumen removal in the emergency department (ED) is often not required; asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with cerumen impaction may be safely discharged home with a cerumen-softening otic and follow-up.

# Tympanic Membrane Perforation

TM perforations can result from middle-ear infections, barotrauma, blunt/ penetrating/acoustic trauma, and, rarely, lightning strikes. Acute pain and hearing loss are usually noted, with or without bloody otorrhea. Vertigo and tinnitus, when present, are usually transient. As most TM perforations heal spontaneously, antibiotics are not necessary unless there is persistent

foreign material in the canal or middle ear. Patients with perforations from isolated blunt or noise trauma can be discharged with expedited specialty referral and should be instructed not to allow water to enter the ear canal.

# Tinnitus

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without external stimuli. It may be constant, pulsatile, high or low pitched, hissing, clicking, or ringing in nature. Objective tinnitus can be heard by the examiner, whereas the more common subjective tinnitus cannot. Causes of tinnitus include vascular, mechanical, neurologic, Ménière's disease, and others. Common medications resulting in tinnitus include aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides,  loop  diuretics,  and  chemotherapeutics.  If  the  patient's  condition allows, potentially offending drugs should be stopped. Accurate diagnosis usually requires referral to an otolaryngologist.

# Hearing Loss

Causes of sudden hearing loss are varied and may be idiopathic (most common),  infectious,  vascular  or  hematologic,  metabolic,  rheumatologic,  or conductive.  Other  causes  include  Ménière's  disease,  Cogan's  syndrome, acoustic neuroma, cochlear rupture, and ototoxic medications. Indicators of poor prognosis include severe hearing loss on presentation and the presence of vertigo. If the cause is not readily determined by history and physical examination, otolaryngologic consultation is necessary.

# ■ NaSaL EMERGENCIES aND SINUSITIS

# Epistaxis

Epistaxis  is  classified  as  anterior  or  posterior.  Posterior  epistaxis  is  suggested if an anterior source is not visualized, if bleeding occurs from both nares, or if blood is seen draining into the posterior pharynx after anterior sources have been controlled.

--- Page 855 ---

CHAPTER 151: Ear, Nose, and Sinus Emergencies

835

Complications of nasal packing include vasovagal syncope, dislodgment  of  the  pack,  recurrent  bleeding,  sinusitis,  and  toxic  shock  syndrome. Treatment of elevated blood pressure during an acute episode of epistaxis is generally not advised except in consultation with an otolaryngologist for cases of persistent epistaxis not controlled by the above measures.

# Nasal Fractures

Nasal fracture is a clinical diagnosis suggested by the injury mechanism, swelling, tenderness, crepitance, gross deformity, and periorbital ecchymosis. Radiographic diagnosis usually is not necessary in the ED. Intermittent ice  application,  analgesics,  and  over-the-counter  decongestants  are  the normal treatment. ENT follow-up within 6 to 10 days for reexamination and possible fracture reduction is prudent.

A fracture of the cribriform plate may violate the subarachnoid space and cause cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Symptoms may be delayed for several weeks. If a cribriform plate injury is suspected, CT and immediate neurosurgical consultation should be obtained.

--- Page 856 ---

836 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

# Nasal Septal Hematoma

A nasal septal hematoma should be suspected whenever there is trauma to the nose. A thorough evaluation of the nasal septum, with good lighting, should  be  performed.  The  septum  should  be  visualized  and  palpated  to assess for a hematoma. A nasal septal hematoma elevates the vascular perichondrium off of the cartilage thus disrupting the blood supply. It is important to remove the hematoma to return blood supply and prevent ischemic necrosis of the septum. If a nasal septal hematoma is identified then evacuation of the hematoma is necessary.

# Nasal Foreign Bodies

Nasal foreign bodies should be suspected in patients with unilateral nasal obstruction, foul rhinorrhea, or persistent unilateral epistaxis. After topical vasoconstriction with 0.05% oxymetazoline and possibly local anesthesia with 4% nebulized lidocaine ,  the foreign body should be removed under direct visualization. Tools for removal include forceps, suction catheters, hooked probes, and balloon-tipped catheters.  Consult  ENT  if  removal  is unsuccessful.

# Sinusitis and Rhinosinusitis

Sinusitis  is  inflammation  of  the  mucosal  lining  of  the  paranasal  sinuses (maxillary, frontal, ethmoid). Rhinosinusitis is sinusitis also involving the nasal cavity, almost always involves rhinitis, and is extremely common. It can be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic.

Symptoms include nasal congestion or blockage, facial pain or pressure, hyposmia, nasal discharge, tooth pain, fever, and sinus pressure with head/ body movement. There may be pain and tenderness with sinus percussion, mucosal swelling, facial swelling, and redness.

Complications  include  meningitis,  cavernous  sinus  thrombosis,  intracranial abscess and empyema, orbital cellulitis, and osteomyelitis. Patients with  these  deeper  complications  usually  appear  systemically  ill  or  have focal neurologic findings.

The  diagnosis  of  uncomplicated  acute  rhinosinusitis  is  clinical,  and imaging is not necessary. CT scans are helpful in evaluating toxic patients and possible intracranial extension. Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis or

--- Page 857 ---

CHAPTER 151: Ear, Nose, and Sinus Emergencies

837

recurrent  acute  rhinosinusitis  warrant  bacterial  cultures  and  a  sinus  CT, preferably as an outpatient.

Treatment  for  acute  uncomplicated  disease  is  generally  supportive. Nasal irrigation with or without nasal decongestants (0.05% oxymetazoline 2  sprays/nostril  two  times  daily  or  0.25% phenylephrine 2  sprays/ nostril  four  times  daily)  is  first-line  therapy.  Decongestant's  use  is  to  be limited to less than or equal to 3 days. Oral antibiotics should be reserved for patients with purulent nasal secretions and severe symptoms for more than 10 days. If prescribed, choices for a 10-day antibiotic regimen include amoxicillin 500 mg PO three times daily (first-line), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg two times daily or erythromycin 250 to 500 mg two times daily (if penicillin allergic), and levofloxacin 500 mg daily (if antibiotics in prior 6 weeks).

# ■ DENTAL ANATOMY

The relevant dental anatomy is shown in Figure 152-1.

# ■ OROFACIAL PAIN

# Tooth Eruption and Pericoronitis

Eruption of the primary teeth ('teething') in children may be the primary cause of pain, irritability, and drooling, but NOT fever and diarrhea; therefore,  other  causes  of  these  latter  symptoms  must  be  excluded.  Give  the child  a frozen,  damp  towel to  suck  on  and acetaminophen 15  mg/kg orally (PO) every 6 hours to control symptoms. Topical anesthetics should

838

CHAPTER 152: Oral and Dental Emergencies

839

be used with great caution in young infants due to its potential to depress the gag reflex.

Adults and teens may experience pericoronitis (pain and local inflammation) with the eruption of the third molars ('wisdom teeth'). Prescribe penicillin VK 500 mg PO four times daily or clindamycin 300 mg PO four times daily, ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg PO three times daily (with or without hydrocodone 5  mg/ acetaminophen 325  mg  one  to  two  tablets  PO  four times daily), and warm saline mouth rinses . Refer the patient to an oral surgeon or a general dentist for consideration of third molar extraction .

# Dental Caries and Pulpitis

Dental caries are caused by bacteriogenic acid eroding through the enamel. Examination  may  reveal  a  grossly  decayed  tooth,  although  occasionally there is no visible pathology-in these cases, localization may be accomplished by percussing individual teeth with a metallic object. If dental caries are not treated, pulpitis is the result. Reversible pulpitis is characterized by sudden, transient pain lasting seconds, often triggered by heat or cold. In contrast irreversible pulpitis pain lasts minutes to hours. Although antibiotics such as penicillin VK 500 mg PO four times daily or clindamycin 300 mg PO four times daily are commonly prescribed for pulpitis, their efficacy  is  controversial.  Treat  with ibuprofen 400  to  800  mg  PO  three times daily, hydrocodone 5 mg/ acetaminophen 325 mg one to two tablets PO four times daily, and warm saline mouth rinses . A dental block may also be performed for short-term pain relief. Refer to a dentist for definitive management. If an abscess is present, antibiotics and incision and drainage should be considered.

# Facial Space infections

Odontogenic infections can spread readily to the facial spaces. Therefore, it is imperative to exclude deep-space involvement whenever a dental infection is encountered. Ludwig's angina is a cellulitis involving both submandibular  spaces  and  the  sublingual  space  that  can  spread  to  the  neck  and mediastinum,  causing  airway  compromise,  overwhelming  infection,  and even death. If dental infections spread to the infraorbital space, a cavernous sinus thrombosis may result. This condition may present with limitation of lateral  gaze,  meningeal  signs,  sepsis,  and  coma. Administer  intravenous antibiotics and obtain emergent surgical consultation for both conditions, with anticoagulation added for cavernous sinus thrombosis.

# Postextraction Pain and Postextraction Alveolar Osteitis (Dry Socket)

Pain experienced within 24 to 48 hours after a tooth extraction responds well  to  icepacks,  head  elevation,  and  analgesics. Postextraction  alveolar osteitis ('dry socket') occurs 48 to 72 hours postoperatively when the clot from  the  socket  is  displaced.  It  is  associated  with  smoking,  carbonated beverage  consumption,  and  drinking  with  straws.  It  presents  with  severe pain  along  with  foul  odor  and  taste.  Perform  gentle saline  or  0.12% chlorhexidine  irrigation of  the  socket,  followed  by  packing  the  socket with eugenol-impregnated gauze ,  which  will  relieve  the  pain.  Prescribe penicillin VK 500 mg PO four times daily or clindamycin 300 mg PO four times daily in severe cases, along with analgesia, daily packing changes,

--- Page 860 ---

840 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

gentle 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinses twice daily, and dental followup in 24 hours.

# Postextraction Bleeding

Control bleeding after dental extraction by instructing the patient to bite on gauze positioned over the bleeding site for 20 minutes. If bleeding persists, pack the socket with Gelfoam ® , Avitene ® , or Surgicel ® . Loosely approximating sutures can be used to hold these packing agents in place. Other emergency department (ED) treatments may include local injection of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine or careful silver nitrate application. Failure of these measures warrants a screening coagulation profile and consultation with an oral surgeon.

# Periodontal Abscess

A periodontal abscess results from plaque and debris entrapped between the tooth and gingiva. For small abscesses, administer penicillin VK 500 mg PO four times daily or clindamycin 300 mg PO four times daily, analgesics ,  and  short-term 0.12%  chlorhexidine  mouth  rinses twice  daily. Larger abscesses require incision and drainage . All patients need prompt dental referral .

# Acute Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis

Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) presents with pain, ulcerated or 'punched out' interdental papillae, gingival bleeding, foul taste, lymphadenopathy, and fever. The associated putrid breath gives this disorder its nickname of 'trench mouth.' It occurs mainly in young patients with compromised resistance to infection due to HIV, stress, malnourishment, substance abuse, and various infections. Prescribe metronidazole 500 mg PO three times daily and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinses twice daily, along with  a  protein-rich  soft  diet,  multivitamins,  and  PO  fluids.  Symptomatic improvement is typically dramatic within 24 hours, and the patient should be referred for dental debridement, scaling, and workup of predisposing factors.

# Peri-implantitis

Dental implants are being increasingly used to replace teeth. If they become infected, they present similarly to a periodontal abscess. Irrigate around the implant with 0.12% chlorhexidine solution and administer metronidazole 500 mg PO three times daily or amoxicillin 500 mg PO three times daily for  10  days.  Prescribe analgesics and  refer  the  patient  to  a  dentist  for definitive management.

# ■ SOFT TISSUE LESIONS OF ThE ORAL CAVITY

# Aphthous Stomatitis

Aphthous stomatitis , or aphthous ulcer, presents with painful lesions, which are frequently multiple, involve the labial and buccal mucosa, and measure from 2 mm to several centimeters in diameter. Treat with 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide dental paste (Kenalog ®  in Orobase ® ) applied topically to lesions two to three times a day or 0.12% chlorhexidine applied topically twice a day. The lesions often heal within 7 to 10 days.

--- Page 861 ---

CHAPTER 152: Oral and Dental Emergencies 841

# Oral Cancer

Emergency physicians should be vigilant for oral cancers and their precursors because early diagnosis is associated with improved outcomes. Cancers  can  present  early  as leukoplakia (nonremovable  white  mucosal patches) and erythroplakia (red patch that cannot be classified as any other disease). The most common site for oral cancer to develop is the posterolateral  border  of  the  tongue.  Symptoms  and  signs  of  oral  cancer  include pain,  paresthesias,  persistent  ulcers,  bleeding,  lesion  rigidity,  induration, lymphadenopathy, and functional impairment. Refer all suspicious lesions or lesions that persist > 14 days despite treatment for urgent follow-up with an oral surgeon for biopsy.

# ■ OROFACIAL TRAUMA

# Dental Fractures

The Ellis  system  is  used  to  classify  the  anatomy  of  fractured  teeth. Ellis class 1 fractures solely involve the enamel. These injuries may be smoothed with an emery board or referred to a dentist for cosmetic repair. Ellis class 2 fractures reveal the creamy yellow dentin underneath the white enamel. The  patient  complains  of  air  and  temperature  sensitivities.  To  decrease pulpal  contamination,  dry  the  dentin  and  promptly  cover  the  lesion  with calcium hydroxide paste or glass ionomer cement . All patients should see a dentist within 24 hours. Ellis class 3 fractures are tooth-threatening fractures that involve the pulp and can be identified by a red blush in the exposed dentin or a visible drop of blood after wiping the tooth. Apply a thin layer of calcium hydroxide paste to cover the pulp, followed by an overlying layer of glass ionomer cement to completely cover the patch and dentin as well. Ideally, a dentist should evaluate the patient in the ED, but if the amount of exposed pulp is very small, the patched lesion can be evaluated by a dentist within 24 hours. Oral analgesics may be needed, but topical anesthetics are contraindicated. The use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial.

# Concussions, Luxations, and Avulsions

Concussion injuries involve posttraumatic tenderness to percussion with no mobility. Posttraumatic mobility without evidence of dislodgment is called subluxation , which has a higher incidence of future pulp necrosis. Prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and soft diet, and refer urgently to a dentist to rule out a more severe injury.

Extrusive luxation occurs  when  a  tooth  is  partly  avulsed  out  from  the alveolar  bone.  Treatment  involves  gentle  repositioning  of  the  tooth  to  its original location (often with the aid of a dental block) and splinting with zinc  oxide periodontal  dressing. A  dentist  should  evaluate  these  patients within 24 hours. When the tooth is laterally displaced with a fracture of the alveolar  bone,  the  condition  is  called lateral  luxation .  Although  manual relocation is possible, the treatment of such injuries is best done in consultation with a dentist. If the alveolar bone fracture is significant, splinting by a dentist in the ED is required. An intrusive luxation occurs when the tooth is forced below the gingiva and often has a poor outcome. For all luxations, prescribe a soft diet, meticulous oral hygiene, and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinses twice daily, and refer to a dentist to be seen within 24 hours.

SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

Dental avulsion is  a  bona  fide  dental  emergency in which a tooth has been  completely  removed  from  the  socket. Primary  teeth in  children are NOT replaced  because  of  potential  damage  to  the  permanent  teeth (Fig. 152-2).

Replant permanent teeth that have been avulsed for less than 3 hours immediately to  attempt  to  save  the  periodontal  ligament  fibers.  At  the scene, handle an avulsed tooth by the crown only, rinse with water < 10 seconds, and replant immediately . If replantation at the scene is not possible due to risk of aspiration, rinse the tooth and place in a nutrient solution, such as Hank's balanced salt solution (preserves cell viability for up to  4  to  6  hours),  cold  milk,  saliva,  or  sterile  saline.  Transport  the  tooth immediately with the patient to the ED. An effective, but somewhat unsettling, way to safely transport the avulsed tooth is underneath the tongue of an alert, sober, cooperative patient or parent (if the patient is a child). Upon arrival in the ED, if the tooth has not already been replanted, gently rinse the tooth with Hank's solution or sterile saline and soak in either fluid. Remove the clot in the empty socket and gently irrigate with sterile normal saline . Examine the tooth to determine whether the apex at the root tip is open,  then  proceed  with  the  appropriate  tooth  replantation  procedure if  indicated.  (See Table  152-1  for  specific  recommendations for tooth replantation.)

Early consultation with a dentist is imperative, but do not delay replantation while awaiting the arrival of the specialist. After replantation, adults should  receive doxycycline 100  mg  PO  BID  for  7  days.  Children < 12 years old should receive penicillin VK 12.5 mg/kg/dose four times a day

for 7 days. If a patient arrives with an empty socket and the tooth cannot be located, search adjacent tissue for the tooth. If a missing tooth cannot be found or if a partial tooth is found, order face, neck, or chest radiographs to exclude a displaced or aspirated tooth.

All types of dental trauma may be associated with alveolar ridge, maxillary, or mandible fractures; therefore, order appropriate imaging studies to exclude these fractures if clinical suspicion warrants. Even with proper treatment, the prognosis of luxated or avulsed teeth can be rather poor (e.g., 50% pulp  necrosis  within  1.5  years  in  extrusive  luxation);  therefore,  be certain to inform the patient of potential suboptimal outcomes and stress the importance of prompt dental follow-up .

844 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

# Soft Tissue Trauma

Stabilize  dental  trauma  before  repairing  soft  tissue  trauma.  In  addition, perform  a  thorough  search  for  retained  foreign  bodies  before  repair  and update  tetanus  status  if  necessary. When  a  child  presents  with  oral trauma, consider the possibility of abuse .

Laceration  of  the maxillary  labial  frenulum usually  does  not  require repair. The lingual frenulum is very vascular and usually should be repaired with 4-0 absorbable sutures .

Tongue lacerations pose a special challenge due to the organ's vascularity.  While  massive  bleeding  or  delayed  venous  swelling  from  tongue trauma can both obstruct the airway, the more common ED presentation involves localized injuries. The indications for closure of tongue lacerations remain controversial. Some authors recommend all lacerations be repaired while others allow nearly any wound to heal by secondary intention. Published  indications  for  primary  closure  include  bisection  of  the  tongue, widely gaping wounds at rest, active bleeding, flap or U-shaped wounds, involvement of the tongue edge, and lacerations > 1 cm. There is general agreement that non-gaping, superficial, linear lacerations < 1 cm located on the central aspect of the dorsal tongue require no repair. An assistant may be  required  to  hold  the  tongue  with  gauze  to  allow  repair.  Obtain  local anesthesia with gauze soaked with 4% lidocaine applied  topically  for  5 minutes. In some cases, local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine or a bilateral lingual nerve block (for lesions located within the anterior  two-thirds  of  the  tongue)  may  be  necessary.  If  greater  control  is required, an anesthetized tip of the tongue may be grasped with a towel clamp or a temporary silk suture may be placed. A dental bite block may be useful to prevent bites to health care providers during repair. Repair lacerations  with 4-0  or  5-0  absorbable  sutures .  Keep  sutures loose (to  avoid necrosis  in  case  the  tongue  swells  significantly  within  the  first  2  days), wide, and deep. Approximate all of the involved tongue layers at once with single-interrupted sutures. Alternatively, a two- or three-layer closure technique may be used. Sometimes in children it is desirable to only close the deep muscle layer while eschewing surface layer closure. This avoids surface knots which can trouble children. Align wound edges as precisely as possible to avoid subsequent formation of clefts, which can have cosmetic and functional consequences. Complete every exposed stitch with at least four  knots to  avoid  the  suture  becoming  undone  by  subsequent  tongue movement. In approximately 7 days, sutures will fall out by themselves or will be absorbed. Aftercare is similar to that of other intraoral lacerations. Obtain emergent specialty consultation for tongue lacerations in patients who require procedural sedation, large or complex lacerations, full or partial amputations, and difficulties with hemostasis.

# ■ PHARYNGITIS AND TONSILLITIS

# Clinical Features

Viral pharyngitis/tonsillitis may present with fever, odynophagia, and petechial or vesicular lesions on the soft palate and tonsils. Compared to bacterial  pharyngitis,  viral  pharyngitis  is  more  often  associated  with  cough, rhinorrhea, and congestion. Viral infections typically lack tonsillar exudates and  cervical  adenopathy.  Bacterial  pharyngitis,  particularly  group  A β -hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis, presents with acute onset of fever, sore throat, odynophagia, and often headache. Patients often display tonsillar erythema, exudates, and tender anterior cervical adenopathy. Cough, conjunctivitis, and rhinorrhea are typically lacking.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The Centor criteria for GABHS pharyngitis are (1) tonsillar exudates, (2) tender anterior cervical adenopathy, (3) absence of cough, and (4) fever. Perform a rapid antigen test on patients with two or more criteria and treat based on the results on the rapid test. Additional diagnostic testing should be performed if mononucleosis, influenza, or acute retroviral syndrome is suspected.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ PERITONSILLAR ABSCESS

# Clinical Features

Patients appear ill and often complain of sore throat, fever, odynophagia, trismus, and dysphagia. A muffled voice may be noted. The infected tonsil is  typically  displaced  medially,  causing  contralateral  deflection  of  the uvula.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Additional conditions to consider include peritonsillar cellulitis, infectious mononucleosis, retropharyngeal abscess, herpes simplex tonsillitis,

845

--- Page 866 ---

846 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

neoplasm,  and  internal  carotid  artery  aneurysm.  Diagnosis  is  typically made through the history and physical exam. If diagnosis is in question, intraoral  ultrasound is very sensitive and specific. CT scan with contrast can be employed if there is concern for extension of infection beyond the peritonsillar space.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ADULT EPIGLOTTITIS (SUPRAGLOTTITIS)

# Clinical Features

Patients typically present with a 1- to 2-day history of worsening dysphagia,  odynophagia,  and  dyspnea,  worse  when  supine,  and  often  will  have anterior neck tenderness with pain on gentle palpation of the larynx and upper trachea. They classically position themselves in the upright position, leaning forward, mouth open, and neck extended, and may display drooling and inspiratory stridor.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is made through history and physical, lateral cervical soft tissue radiograph with obliteration of the vallecula and a 'thumb print sign', and/ or transnasal fiberoptic laryngoscopy.

# ■ RETROPHARYNGEAL ABSCESS

# Clinical Features

Common symptoms include sore throat, neck pain, torticollis, and dysphagia. Additionally, patients may have a muffled voice, cervical adenopathy, and respiratory distress. Stridor is more common in children.

# Diagnosis and Differential

A CT of the neck with IV contrast is the gold standard diagnostic exam and differentiates cellulitis from an abscess.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ ODONTOGENIC ABSCESS

# Clinical Features

Most deep space neck infections are odontogenic, usually from the mandibular teeth. Patients may present with trismus, fever, neck mass, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Infection can range from diffuse cellulitis to abscesses in the  labial  or  buccal  gingiva.  Infections  can  spread  through  many  fascial layers into potential spaces in the face, neck, and mouth.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Bedside  ultrasound  can  detect  superficial  odontogenic  abscesses,  but  if deep  space  infection  is  suspected,  CT  of  the  neck  with  IV  contrast  is recommended.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# Complications

Ludwig's angina is an infection of the submental, sublingual, and submandibular spaces. Clinical exam reveals trismus and edema of the entire upper neck and floor of the mouth. Critically ill patients may have a necrotizing infection. These  are  associated  with  skin  discoloration,  crepitus  of  the subcutaneous tissue, and systemic signs of illness including fever, tachycardia,  hypotension,  and  confusion. Immediate  surgical  consultation is required, as these patients need fasciotomy with wide local debridement and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.

# ■ NECK AND UPPER AIRWAY MASSES

# Clinical Features

Neck masses can be congenital, infectious, glandular, or neoplastic. In adults > 40 years old, up to 80% of lateral neck masses persistent for > 6 weeks are malignant.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Patients with airway compromise or significant dysphagia or odynophagia should be evaluated using flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy before CT scan. CT scan is often required for planning surgical intervention and will help to delineate the extent of the mass (Table 153-1).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ POSTTONSILLECTOMY BLEEDING

# Clinical Features

Postoperative bleeding is a well-known complication of tonsillectomy and can cause death from airway obstruction or hemorrhagic shock. Incidence ranges from 1% to 8.8% with about half of patients requiring surgical intervention to control bleeding. Most significant hemorrhage occurs between postoperative days 5 and 10, but bleeding can be seen within 24 hours of surgery.

# ■ COMPLICATIONS OF AIRWAY DEVICES

# Tracheostomy Tubes and Cannulas

Early  complications  include  bleeding,  obstruction,  dislodgement,  and infection. These typically occur within the first postoperative week. Late complications  like  granulation,  tracheal  stenosis,  and  fistula  formation occur  after  the  first  postoperative  week.  Emergency  medicine  providers must be proficient in replacing uncuffed with cuffed tracheostomy tubes for mechanical ventilation, replacement of tracheostomy tubes after accidental decannulation, correction of tube obstruction, and control of bleeding or infection at the tracheostomy site.

# Tracheostomy Tube with Airway Obstruction

If the tracheostomy tube is patent, leave it in place. Consider mucus plugging of the trachea or mainstem bronchi distal to the tube and attempt to suction. Preoxygenation and placement of sterile saline into the trachea will aid in suctioning. You may have to remove the inner cannula and occasionally the entire tracheostomy tube if suctioning fails.

# Tracheostomy Dislodgement

If  a  suction  catheter  cannot be passed through the tube and on x-ray the tracheostomy tube is seen extrinsically compressing the trachea, the tube is likely dislodged. Remove the entire tracheostomy tube. Insert a nasopharyngoscope or flexible bronchoscope into the visible stoma to identify the true tracheal opening. If the opening cannot be identified obtain otolaryngology or general surgery consultation. If the patient cannot maintain his or her airway, you should orally intubate.

# Tracheostomy Site Infection

Stomal skin infection, tracheitis, and bronchitis can be recurring problems. Treat polymicrobial infections in stable patients with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg PO twice daily. Unstable or systemically ill patients should receive piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV plus vancomycin 1 g IV . Add a fluoroquinolone  for Pseudomonas .  Local  wound  infections  can  be  treated  with gauze soaked in 0.25% acetic acid .

# Tracheostomy Site bleeding

Sources of hemorrhage include granulation tissue in the stoma, trachea, or thyroid or erosion of the thyroid vessels, the tracheal wall, or the innominate  artery.  Packing  with  saline  soaked  gauze  can  control  slow  bleeding from the stoma. If this is ineffective remove the tube and examine the stoma and tracheal wall. Local bleeding can be controlled with silver nitrate . If bleeding is brisk, replace the tracheostomy tube with a cuffed endotracheal tube with the cuff below the bleeding site.

--- Page 870 ---

850 SECTION 16: Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Oral Emergencies

Tracheoinnominate artery fistula is a rare but life-threatening complication of tracheostomy. This is typically seen during the first 3 weeks after tracheostomy and is due to vessel erosion from high ( > 25 mm Hg) cuff pressures or direct  pressure  from  the  tip  of  the  tracheal  cannula  against  the  innominate artery.  Some  patients  present  with  hemoptysis  or  a  sentinel  arterial  bleed. Immediate orolaryngologic or thoracic surgery consultation is required.

If the patient presents with massive bleeding, the first maneuver is to hyperinflate the cuff to control brisk bleeding while planning operative  intervention .  If  bleeding  persists,  slowly  withdraw  the  tube  while exerting anterior pressure on the anterior trachea. If these interventions fail to control bleeding, place an endotracheal tube from above the tracheoinnominate fistula, using direct visualization with a flexible intubating scope while an assistant removes the tracheostomy tube allowing the endotracheal tube to pass. Then use digital pressure of the innominate artery against the manubrium to control stomal hemorrhage.

# Tracheal Stenosis

Weeks to  months  after  decannulation,  mucosal  necrosis,  and  subsequent scarring can cause tracheal stenosis. Patients with stenosis have dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, and inability to clear secretions. Treatment in the emergency  department  includes humidified  oxygen,  nebulized  racemic  epinephrine, and steroids . Further treatment may include rigid bronchoscopy laser excision of scar bands, stenting, or tracheal reconstruction.

# Changing a Tracheostomy Tube

If the tracheostomy is less than 7 days old and the situation is not emergent, tracheostomy tubes should be changed by a surgeon familiar with the procedure, as tracts are not yet mature and manipulation may easily create a false passage. Tracts can also easily collapse in patients with obesity or neck masses.

# ■ LARYNGECTOMY PATIENTS

It is impossible to orally intubate patients after laryngectomy . Laryngectomy patients can be emergently intubated by placing an endobronchial tube into the tracheostoma. Do not advance the tube too far, as the carina can be only 4 to 6 cm from the tracheostoma.

# Speech Devices

A Passy-Muir valve is a one-way valve that fits directly over the opening of an uncuffed tracheostomy tube, allowing for hands free speech. Because patients exhale around the tracheostomy tube, a Passy Muir valve should not  be  used  with  a  cuffed  tube. If  a  patient  with  a  Passy-Muir  valve develops respiratory distress or an inability to speak, your first intervention should be to remove the speech valve. Then check the tracheostomy tube for obstruction .

# ■ ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME AND STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME

# Clinical Features

Erythema multiforme (EM) strikes all ages, with the highest incidence in young adults  (20  to  40  years  of  age).  It  affects  males  twice  as  often  as females, and occurs more commonly in the spring and fall. EM is an acute inflammatory skin disease with presentations that range from a mild papular  eruption  (EM  minor)  to  diffuse  vesiculobullous  lesions  with  mucous membrane  involvement  and  systemic  toxicity  (Stevens-Johnson  syndrome).  Precipitating  factors  include  infection  (mycoplasma  and  herpes simplex),  drugs  (antibiotics  and  anticonvulsants),  and  malignancy.  No specific cause is found in about half of the cases.

Malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, fever, a generalized burning sensation, and  diffuse  pruritus  may  precede  the  development  of  skin  lesions.  Skin lesions begin as erythematous papules and macular lesions followed by the development of target lesions in 24 to 48 hours. Lesions can be diffuse and may be located on the palms and soles. Urticarial plaques, vesicles, bullae, vesiculobullous  lesions,  and  mucosal  (oral,  conjunctival,  respiratory,  and genitourinary) erosions may also develop (Fig. 154-1). Systemic toxicity along  with  significant  fluid  and  electrolyte  deficiencies  and  secondary infections may be seen in severe disease.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Target lesions are highly suggestive of EM. The presence of mucosal involvement suggests Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The differential diagnosis includes herpetic infections, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, primary blistering disorders, Kawasaki disease, and the toxic and infectious erythemas.

852

SECTION 17: Disorders of the Skin

Prednisone 60 to 80 mg PO daily for 3 to 5 days are often prescribed for mild  disease  but  are  unproven  to  change  duration  and  outcomes. Acyclovir may reduce recurrent HSV-related EM.

# ■ TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe inflammatory skin disease that strikes all ages and both sexes equally. Some authorities consider TEN to be a variant of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

# Clinical Features

Potential  etiologies  include  chemicals,  infections,  and  malignancy,  but medications are the most common causes of TEN. Malaise, anorexia, myalgias, arthralgias, fever, and upper respiratory infection symptoms may precede  skin  findings  by  1  to  2  weeks.  Skin  findings  progress  from  tender erythematous areas that become confluent within hours to flaccid bullae and erosions with exfoliation (Fig. 154-2). A positive Nikolsky sign is slippage of the epidermis from the dermis when slight tangential pressure is applied

to the skin. Systemic toxicity as well as oral, ocular, and anogenital mucosal lesions are common. TEN has a mortality rate of 25% to 35%, and poor prognostic  indicators  include  advanced  age,  extensive  disease,  multiple medication use, leukopenia, azotemia, and thrombocytopenia.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Initial diagnosis is based on the clinical features, while skin biopsy results can  confirm  the  diagnosis.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, primary blistering disorders, Kawasaki disease, and toxic infectious erythemas.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ MENINGOCOCCEMIA

# Clinical Features

Meningococcemia  is  a  serious  and  potentially  fatal  systemic  infection caused by Neisseria meningitides . Clinical disease usually develops within 3 to 4 days after exposure and can present with a fulminant course. Possible presenting features can include headache, fever, altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgia, and neck stiffness. Dermatologic manifestations of this infection include petechia, urticaria, hemorrhagic vesicles, and macules that evolve into palpable purpura with grey necrotic centers.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Consider meningococcemia in ill-appearing patients with a petechial rash and associated symptoms of infection. The differential diagnosis includes

--- Page 874 ---

854 SECTION 17: Disorders of the Skin

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, toxic shock syndrome, gonococcemia, bacterial  endocarditis,  vasculitis,  viral  and  bacterial  infections,  and  disseminated intravascular coagulation.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS

# Clinical Features

Pemphigus vulgaris is a generalized, mucocutaneous, autoimmune, blistering eruption with a grave prognosis. Primary lesions are clear, tense vesicles or bullae that vary in diameter, and are first noted on the head, trunk, and mucous membranes. Within 2 to 3 days, the bullae become turbid and flaccid then rupture, producing painful, denuded areas that are slow to heal and prone to secondary infection (Fig. 154-3).

# Diagnosis and Differential

Pemphigus  vulgaris  is  suspected  by  the  appearance  of  lesions  and  confirmed  by  skin  biopsy  and  immunofluorescence  testing.  The  differential diagnosis  includes  bullous  pemphigoid, TEN,  EM  major,  dermatitis  herpetiformis,  and  other  blistering  skin  diseases.  Bullous  pemphigoid  is  a mucocutaneous blistering disease typically found in the elderly.

# ■ HERPES ZOSTER

# Clinical Features

Herpes zoster results  from  cutaneous  activation  of  latent  varicella  zoster virus  along  a  sensory  nerve  root  dermatome.  Pain  or  dysesthesia  in  an involved dermatome begins 3 to 5 days before lesions emerge. Erythematous papules develop first, progress to vesicular clusters, and these lesions crust  after  about  a  week.  Herpes  zoster  of  the  ophthalmic  branch  of  the trigeminal  nerve,  especially  if  accompanied  by  lesions  on  the  nose,  are concerning for possible eye involvement that can lead to keratitis or corneal ulceration  (Fig.  155-1). A  thorough  eye  exam  should  be  performed  (see Chapter  149,  'Ocular  Emergencies').  Generalized  eruptions  involving more than one dermatome may occur in immunocompromised patients.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The differential diagnosis for these kinds of skin eruptions includes herpes simplex, impetigo, and contact dermatitis. The characteristic skin rash of herpes  zoster  presents  in  a  unilateral  distribution  along  a  single  sensory dermatome and is accompanied by localized pain at the site. A swab of the

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTIONS

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions are painful grouped vesicles with an erythematous base. Primary disease may be preceded with or accompanied by constitutional symptoms. Tingling or burning precedes recurrent lesions. Oral lesions ('cold sores') are usually caused by HSV1, but may also be caused by HSV2. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an HSV PCR test if necessary. Treatment (Table 155-1) is most effective when started within 24 hours  of  symptom  onset.  See  Chapter  87,  'Sexually  Transmitted  Infections,' for discussion and treatment of genital herpes.

# ■ TINEa INFECTIONS

# Clinical Features

Tinea  refers  to  skin  infections  caused  by  dermatophytes  (fungi). Tinea capitis is  characterized by patchy areas of alopecia with broken off hairs and scales at the periphery. Tinea barbae presents with severe inflammatory plaques and follicular pustules in the beard area. Interdigital scaling, maceration, plantar or palmar erythema or scaling, and pruritis are seen in

Tinea  pedis (also  known  as  athlete's  foot)  and Tinea  manuum (hand). Onchomycosis may occur. Findings in Tinea cruris (commonly called jock itch)  include  erythema with a peripheral annular scaly edge that extends onto  the  thighs  and  buttocks  but  spares  the  penis  and  scrotum. Candida intertrigo involves the skinfolds. Tinea Corporus (trunk, neck, arms, and legs lesions) are typically circular, covered with scales and surrounded by a raised border.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Identification of fungal elements on a potassium hydroxide preparation or with  fungal  culture  may  be  completed  if  the  diagnosis  is  uncertain.  The differential  diagnosis  includes  psoriasis,  atopic,  seborrheic,  and  chronic dermatitis (Table 155-2).

# ■ aLLERGIC CONTaCT DERMaTITIS

# Clinical Features

Contact dermatitis occurs after direct contact with an irritant or allergen. Reactions occasionally occur after exposure to aerosolized particles, such as burned poison ivy or oak. Detergents and soaps are common irritants, while nickel, plants, cosmetic preservatives, contact lens solutions, and skin

# ■ SUNBURN aND PHOTOSENSITIVITY

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  sunburn  have  an  inflammatory  response  to  ultraviolet  (UV) radiation and may present with minimal discomfort in mild cases or extreme pain with extensive blistering for more severe exposures. Tender and warm areas of erythema in sun-exposed areas are characteristic of sunburn. Sunburn reactions develop 2 to 6 hours after exposure and peak in 1 to 3 days.

Exogenous photosensitivity disorders result from topical application or ingestion of an agent that increases the skin's sensitivity when exposed to UV light. Photosensitivity disorders may be phototoxic (occur quickly with characteristics similar to sunburn) or photoallergic (delayed onset characterized by eczema-like changes with vesiculation). Photosensitivity eruptions occur on sun-exposed skin and are associated with topically applied furocoumarins (lime juice, various fragrances, figs, celery, parsnips), and numerous  medications,  including  sulfonamides,  thiazides,  furosemide, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ SECONDaRY SYPHILIS

# Clinical Features

Early secondary syphilis eruptions emerge 2 to 10 weeks after the appearance of the primary chancre (see Chapter 87, 'Sexually Transmitted Infections'). This  evanescent  macular rash on the trunk and inner extremities may last only a few hours or days. Subsequent rash, often referred to as the 'great  imitator'  because  of  the  varied  clinical  appearance,  lasts  2  to  6 weeks and may present in a variety of forms. These eruptions are often papular  lesions  2  to  5  mm  in  size,  generalized,  and  reddish  to  copper  in color. Involvement of the palms and soles is a helpful diagnostic finding. Consider risk factors and the possibility of secondary syphilis rash when

evaluating patients with papulosquamous conditions (Fig. 155-2). The nontreponemal  serologic  tests  are  frequently  strongly  reactive  in  secondary syphilis and can be helpful for diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treat secondary syphilis with benzathine penicillin G (single dose of 2.4 million IM, 1.2 million units in each buttock). Doxycycline ,  100  mg  PO twice a day for 2 weeks, can be used in patients with penicillin allergy.

# ■ MOLLUSCUM CONTaGIOSUM

Molluscum  contagiosum  is  a  common  viral  infection  of  the  epidermis occurring in children, sexually active adults, and immunosuppressed individuals (especially patients with human  immunodeficiency virus).

--- Page 882 ---

862

SECTION 17: Disorders of the Skin

Transmission is by direct skin-to-skin contact. These lesions can present as a single skin-colored, pearly, umbilicated papule (1 to 2  mm) or as multiple, scattered papules or nodules and plaques (5 to 10 mm) (Fig. 155-3). Autoinnoculation may lead to clustering of lesions by scratching. Most patients do not  require  specific  treatment  for  this  condition  and  it  typically  resolves within 6 months to 4 years. Options for treatment in appropriate circumstances include curettage, cryotherapy, or electrodesiccation. In individuals with human immunodeficiency virus, treatment of the underlying human immunodeficiency virus infection may lead to resolution.

# ■ HIDRaDENITIS SUPPURaTIVa

Hidradenitis suppurativa is an inflammatory condition, typically affecting the  apocrine  gland-bearing  areas  of  the  skin  with  recurrent,  painful,  and draining nodules. The inciting event is follicular occlusion, prompting rupture of the follicular contents, and resulting intense inflammation. Axillary and inguinal skin demonstrates varying numbers of inflammatory nodules, many of which may form connecting tracts, with resultant drainage onto the skin surface (Fig. 155-4). See Chapter 90, 'Soft Tissue Infections.'

SECTION

# Trauma

Trauma care is guided by the concepts of rapid assessment, triage, resuscitation, serial reassessment, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Trauma patients can sustain a multitude of injuries. Many people will present with abnormal vital signs, neurologic deficits, or other gross evidence of injury. These signs should prompt both a thorough search for the specific underlying  injuries  and  rapid  interventions  to  correct  the  abnormalities. Nonspecific  signs  such  as  tachycardia,  tachypnea,  or  mild  alterations  in consciousness should similarly be presumed to signify serious injury until proven otherwise. Further, without signs of significant trauma, the mechanism of injury may suggest potential problems, which should be pursued diligently.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The assessment of trauma patients begins with a focused history from the patient,  family  members,  witnesses,  or  prehospital  providers.  Patterns  of injuries, and expected physiologic responses to these injuries, can be ascertained  by  collecting  history  regarding  the  circumstances  of  the  event (e.g., single vehicle crash, fall from height, smoke inhalation, or environmental exposures), ingestion of intoxicants, preexisting medical conditions, and medications.

To facilitate an organized approach to the trauma patient, the examination is divided into primary and secondary surveys (Table 156-1). The goal of the primary survey is to identify and immediately treat life-threatening conditions.  To  do  so,  the  acronym  ABCDE  encourages  the  clinician  to examine the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and disability (mental status, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and neurologic examination), and to completely  expose  each  patient  so  that  occult  injuries  or  exposures  are visualized. After this initial primary survey, perform a thorough head-to-toe examination (the secondary survey, Table 156-1), then proceed with appropriate diagnostic testing and further therapeutic interventions.

Perform endotracheal intubation with in-line stabilization for patient with depressed level of consciousness or inability to protect airway.

Create surgical airway if there is significant bleeding or obstruction or laryngoscopy cannot be performed.

# b.  breathing

Ventilate with 100% oxygen; monitor oxygen saturation.

Auscultate for breath sounds.

Place two large-bore peripheral IV catheters.

Begin rapid infusion of warm crystalloid solution, if indicated.

Apply direct pressure to sites of brisk external bleeding.

Consider central venous or interosseous access if peripheral sites are unavailable.

Consider pericardiocentesis for suspected pericardial tamponade.

Trauma is the most common cause of death in children older than 1 year. Differences in anatomy and physiology mandate modifications to trauma evaluation and management in children.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Head trauma is the most frequent pediatric injury resulting in death. Overall, motor vehicle crash is the most common mechanism, and it is the leading mechanism of traumatic death in children older than 1 year.

Airway: Airway management in children can be challenging. Anatomic differences include a large occiput, large tongue, and cephalad location of the larynx.

Breathing: Observe the rate, depth, pattern, and work of breathing as well as symmetry of rise and fall of the chest wall. Agitation or somnolence could be a result of hypoxia or hypercapnea, respectively. Children experience oxygen desaturation more quickly due to high oxygen demand and small lungs.

Circulation: Recognize  early  signs  of  circulatory  shock  including tachycardia, mental status changes, and color and perfusion abnormalities, because  hypotension  is  typically  a  terminal  event  in  children.  Estimate normal systolic blood pressure in children 1 to 10 years of age using the following formula: 90 + (2 × age) mm Hg; hypotension can be estimated as systolic blood pressure less than 70 + (2 × age) mm Hg.

Disability: In younger children, the Modified Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 157-1) should be used. This mirrors the Glasgow Coma Scale for  eye  opening  and  motor  responses,  but  incorporates  age-appropriate modifications for verbal responses. Perform a pupillary examination and basic assessment of tone and strength.

Exposure: Disrobe and expose the child to completely assess for injuries.  However,  the  ratio  of  surface  area  to  mass  is  greater  in  children, putting them at greater risk for hypothermia. Care should be taken to maintain normothermia.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

# Head Injury

Infants  and  neonates  are  at  the  highest  risk  of  significant  intracranial injury. Mental status assessment should account for developmental stage and  patient  anxiety.  Parietal  and  occipital  skull  fractures  are  frequently

associated  with  intracranial  bleeding.  Noncontrast  CT  is  the  imaging modality of choice for intracranial injury in children. Scalp injuries, particularly in neonates, may result in significant blood loss and shock. Please see Chapter 160 for a discussion on CT imaging in head trauma.

# Spine Injuries

Young  children  with  spinal  cord  injuries  often  do  not  have  associated fractures since the ligaments are relatively elastic. 'Clearing the cervical spine' in children is challenging as there is little evidence to guide practice.  Multisystem  trauma  and  head  trauma  are  general  indications  for neck immobilization and cervical spine imaging. Please see Chapter 161 for  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  management  of  spine  and  spinal  cord injuries. Due to the nature of spine injuries and the need to lower ionizing radiation, plain films of the spine remain a useful tool.

# Chest Trauma

The chest radiograph is an essential tool in the evaluation of any child with chest  trauma  and  CT  imaging  of  the  chest  rarely  changes  management. Pulmonary contusions are the most common thoracic injury in children. The relatively compliant chest wall of the child means that serious injuries to intrathoracic structures can be present without significant external signs. Rib fractures are less common in children and generally require a significant mechanism of injury.

# abdominal and Genitourinary Trauma

Indications for CT include suspicious mechanism of injury, tenderness on exam, seatbelt sign, distention, and vomiting. A study of over 12,000 pediatric  patients  with  blunt  abdominal  trauma  recently  found  the  following factors predicted very low risk for significant intraabdominal injury: (1) no evidence of abdominal wall trauma/seat belt sign nor Glasgow Coma Scale < 14 with blunt abdominal trauma; (2) no abdominal tenderness on examination; and (3) no thoracic wall trauma, and no complaints of abdominal pain, decreased bowel sounds, or vomiting. Identification of a pelvic fracture, particularly an anterior ring fracture, should prompt investigation for associated urethral or bladder injury. The role of ultrasound for pediatric abdominal trauma, especially in stable patients, is not well established.

# Trauma in the Elderly

O. John Ma

Emergency physicians need to be aware of the many unique mechanisms of injury  and  clinical  features  associated  with  geriatric  trauma  patients  and apply special management principles when caring for them.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Falls  are  the  most  common cause of fatal and non-fatal injury in people ≥ 65 years of age. Syncope, which has been implicated in many cases, may be  secondary  to  dysrhythmias,  venous  pooling,  autonomic  derangement, hypoxia, anemia, or hypoglycemia. Motor vehicle crashes are the second most common cause of injury in the elderly and are the leading cause of death. Elderly pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle are much more likely to  die  than  younger pedestrians. Intentional injuries and those caused by neglect should also be considered.

Evaluate  the  geriatric  trauma  patient  as  both  a  medical  and  a  trauma patient. Since elderly patients may have a significant past medical history that impacts their trauma care, obtaining a precise history is vital. Family members, medical records, and the patient's primary physician may be helpful in gathering information regarding the traumatic event and the patient's previous level of function. Document medications, such as cardiac agents, diuretics, psychotropic agents, and anticoagulants. Investigating the cause of a fall may uncover serious underlying medical causes or prevent future trauma.

On physical examination, frequent monitoring of vital signs is essential. Avoid  feeling  reassured  by  'normal'  vital  signs.  A  normal  tachycardic response to pain, hypovolemia, or anxiety may be absent or blunted in the elderly trauma patient. Medications such as β -blockers may mask tachycardia and delay appropriate resuscitation. Blood pressures are also misleading in the elderly patient. Because of the high incidence of underlying hypertension, consider using a higher cutoff for hypotension than in younger patients. In blunt trauma patients ≥ 65 years, mortality increases when systolic blood pressure dips below 110 mm Hg and heart rates exceed 90 beats per minute.

Pay  special  attention  to  anatomical  variations  that  may  make  airway management more difficult. These include the presence of dentures, cervical  arthritis,  or  temporomandibular  joint  arthritis. A  thorough  secondary survey is essential to uncover less serious injuries. These 'minor' injuries may not be severe enough to cause problems during the initial resuscitation, but cumulatively may cause significant morbidity and mortality. Seemingly stable geriatric trauma patients can deteriorate rapidly and without warning.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

# Head Injury

Never  assume  that  alterations  in  mental  status  are  due  solely  to  any underlying  dementia  or  senility  when  evaluating  the  elderly  patient's mental status. Elderly persons suffer a much lower incidence of epidural

873

--- Page 894 ---

874 SECTION 18: Trauma

hematomas than the general population; however, there is a higher incidence of subdural and intraparenchymal hematomas in the elderly than in younger patients. The rate of intracranial hemorrhage approaches 7% to 14% in anticoagulated patients with blunt head injury who are experiencing  no  or  minimal  symptoms.  Order  non-contrast  head  CT  for patients who take warfarin and have a mechanism of injury concerning for even a minor head injury.

# Cervical Spine Injuries

The pattern of cervical spine injuries in the elderly is different than in younger patients, as there is an increased incidence of C1 and C2 fractures  with  the  elderly.  Place  special  emphasis  on  maintaining  cervical immobilization until the cervical spine is properly assessed. Because of the  higher  pre-test  probability  of  injury,  as  well  as  the  difficulties  in interpreting plain radiographs in a patient with age-related degeneration, CT  scan  is  the  preferred  initial  modality  for  assessing  the  geriatric cervical spine.

# Chest Trauma

Rib  fractures  are  more  common  after  blunt  trauma  due  to  osteoporotic changes. The pain associated with rib fractures, along with any decreased physiologic reserve, may predispose patients to respiratory complications. More  severe  thoracic  injuries,  such  as  hemopneumothorax,  pulmonary contusion, flail chest, and cardiac contusion, can quickly lead to decompensation in elderly individuals whose baseline oxygenation status may already be diminished.

# Abdominal Trauma

The abdominal examination in elderly  patients  is  notoriously  unreliable. The focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination assists  in  evaluating  for  hemoperitoneum  and  the  need  for  exploratory laparotomy in hemodynamically unstable patients. The FAST examination has largely replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Use CT with contrast for patients who are hemodynamically stable. Ensure adequate hydration and baseline assessment of renal function prior to the contrast load for the CT scan. Some patients may be volume-depleted due to medications, such as diuretics.  This  hypovolemia  coupled  with  contrast  administration  may exacerbate any underlying renal pathology.

# Orthopedic Injuries

Hip fractures occur primarily in four areas: intertrochanteric, transcervical, subcapital,  and  subtrochanteric.  Intertrochanteric  fractures  are  the  most common, followed by transcervical fractures. Be aware that pelvic and long bone fractures  are  not  infrequently  the  sole  etiology  for  hypovolemia  in elderly patients. Coordinate timely orthopedic consultation, evaluation, and treatment with open reduction and internal fixation with the diagnosis and management of other injuries. Consider ordering CT of the pelvis in stable patients  with  pelvic  tenderness  after  an  injury  if  plain  radiographs  are negative.

--- Page 895 ---

CHAPTER 158: Trauma in the Elderly

875

Long bone fractures of the femur, tibia, and humerus may produce a loss of mobility with a resulting decrease in the independent lifestyle of elderly patients. Early orthopedic consultation for intramedullary rodding of these fractures may result in increased early mobilization.

The incidence of Colles fractures and humeral head and surgical neck fractures in elderly patients is increased by falls on the outstretched hand or elbow.  Localized  tenderness,  swelling,  and  ecchymosis  to  the  proximal humerus are characteristic of these injuries. Arrange for early orthopedic referral.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

As in  all  trauma  patients,  perform  the  primary  and  secondary  surveys expeditiously.

Trauma  is  the  leading  cause  of  nonobstetric  morbidity  and  mortality  in pregnant women. Motor vehicle collisions followed by falls and domestic violence  are  the  most  common  causes  of  trauma  in  pregnancy  and  fetal survival is highly dependent on maternal stabilization.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Physiologic  changes  of  pregnancy  make  it  difficult  to  determine  the severity of injury. Heart rate increases 10 to 20 beats per minute in the second trimester while systolic and diastolic blood pressures drop 10 to 15  mm  Hg.  Blood  volume  can  increase  by  45%,  but  red  cell  mass increases to a lesser extent, leading to a physiologic anemia of pregnancy. It  may  be  difficult  to  determine  whether  tachycardia,  hypotension,  or anemia is due to blood loss or normal physiologic changes. Due to the relative hypervolemic state, the patient may lose 30% to 35% of blood volume before manifesting signs of shock. Pulmonary changes in pregnancy  include  elevation  of  the  diaphragm  and  a  decrease  in  residual volume and function residual capacity. Tidal volume increases, resulting in hyperventilation with associated respiratory alkalosis. However, renal compensation  causes  the  serum  pH  to  remain  unchanged.  Gastric emptying is also delayed, which places the pregnant trauma patient at a higher risk of aspiration.

The anatomic changes in pregnancy affect the types of injuries that are typically  seen  in  the  mother.  Splenic  injury  remains  the  most  common cause of abdominal hemorrhage in the pregnant trauma patient. After the 12th week of gestation, the enlarging uterus emerges from the pelvis and by 20 weeks reaches the level of the umbilicus. Uterine blood flow increases, making severe maternal hemorrhage from uterine trauma more likely. The uterus also can compress the inferior vena cava when the patient is supine, leading to the 'supine hypotension syndrome.' As pregnancy progresses, the small intestines are pushed cephalad, which causes an increased likelihood of injury in penetrating trauma to the upper abdomen. The bladder moves into the abdomen in the third trimester, thereby increasing its susceptibility to injury.

Abdominal  trauma  affects  not  only  the  mother  but  also  the  fetus. Fetal  injuries  are  more  likely  to  be  seen  in  the  third  trimester  and  are often  associated  with  pelvic  fractures  or  penetrating  trauma  in  the mother. Uterine rupture is rare but is associated with a very high fetal mortality  rate.  More  common  complications  of  trauma  include  uterine irritability,  preterm  labor,  and  placental  abruption.  Classically,  the mother will demonstrate abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and uterine contractions.  Fetal-maternal  hemorrhage  occurs  in  more  than  30%  of cases of significant trauma and may result in rhesus (Rh) isoimmunization of Rh-negative women.

877

878 SECTION 18: Trauma

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Maternal stability and survival offer the best chance for fetal well-being, and no critical interventions or diagnostic procedures should be withheld out of concern for potential adverse effects to the fetus. The initial sequence of trauma resuscitation is unchanged. Special attention should be directed to  the  gravid  abdomen,  examining  for  evidence  of  injury,  tenderness,  or uterine contractions. If abdominal or pelvic trauma is suspected, perform a sterile pelvic examination to assess for genital trauma, vaginal bleeding, or ruptured amniotic membranes after pelvic ultrasound to determine placental  location.  Fluid with a pH of 7 in the vaginal canal suggests amniotic rupture, as does 'ferning,' a branch-like pattern on drying of vaginal fluid on a microscope slide.

Initial laboratory studies include a complete blood count, serum chemistries, blood type, Rh status, and coagulation studies including fibrin split products and fibrinogen to determine the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The Apt test or Kleihauer-Betke test should be obtained to assess for the presence of fetal hemoglobin in the maternal blood.

Obtain radiographs based on fundamental principles of trauma management. Adverse fetal effects from radiation are negligible from doses < 5 rad, which is an exposure far greater than that received from most plain radiographs.  Reducing  the  number  of  imaging  CT  cuts  and  shielding  of  the abdomen and pelvis when possible may decrease radiation exposure from medical imaging. Bedside ultrasonography is a highly sensitive, specific, and  radiation-free  alternative  for  imaging  the  abdomen.  In  addition  to evaluating fetal heart rate, ultrasonography can assess gestational age, fetal activity or demise, placental location, and amniotic fluid volume. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage has largely been replaced by ultrasonography. If it is indicated, use the open supraumbilical technique.

Auscultate fetal heart tones to determine fetal viability and identify fetal distress early in the evaluation. A Doppler stethoscope or ultrasound facilitates  this  assessment. A  normal  fetal  heart  rate  ranges  between  120  and 160 beats per minute. Fetal bradycardia is most likely a result of hypoxia due to maternal hypotension, respiratory compromise, or placental abruption. Fetal tachycardia is most likely due to hypoxia or hypovolemia. In the setting of blunt abdominal trauma, external fetal monitoring is indicated for at  least  4  to  6  hours  for  all  patients  beyond  week  20  of  gestation.  Fetal tachycardia, lack of beat-to-beat or long-term variability, or late decelerations on tocodynamometry are diagnostic of fetal distress and may be indications for emergent cesarean section if beyond the viable gestational age.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

As is the case of all trauma patients, initial priorities are the primary and secondary surveys directed at the pregnant trauma patient. Coordinate care with surgical and obstetric consultants.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the impairment in brain function after direct or indirect forces to the brain. The force of an object striking the head or a penetrating injury causes direct injury. Indirect injuries occur from acceleration/deceleration forces that result in the movement of the brain within the skull.

Traumatic  brain  injury  can  be  classified  as  mild,  moderate,  and severe. Mild TBI includes patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS, see Table 160-1) score ≥ 14. Patients may be asymptomatic with only a history of head trauma, or may be confused and amnestic of the event. They may have experienced a brief loss of consciousness and complain

of a diffuse headache, nausea, and vomiting. Patients at high risk in this subgroup include those with a skull fracture, large subgaleal swelling, focal neurologic findings, coagulopathy, age > 60 years, or drug/alcohol intoxication.

Moderate TBI includes patients with a GCS score of 9 to 13. Overall, 40% of these  patients  have  an  abnormality  on  CT  scan  and  8%  require neurosurgical intervention.

The  mortality  of  severe  TBI  (GCS  score < 9)  approaches  40%.  The immediate clinical priority in these patients is to prevent secondary brain injury, identify other life-threatening injuries, and identify treatable neurosurgical conditions.

Prehospital medical personnel often provide critical parts of the history,  including  mechanism  and  time  of  injury,  presence  and  length  of unconsciousness, initial mental status, seizure activity, vomiting, verbalization, and movement of extremities. For an unresponsive patient, contact family and friends to gather key information including past medical history, medications (especially anticoagulants), and recent use of alcohol or drugs.

Perform a detailed neurologic examination that includes assessing the mental status and GCS, pupils for size, reactivity, and anisocoria, cranial nerve function, motor and sensory function, and any development of decorticate or decerebrate posturing.

# Specific Injuries

# Skull Fractures

Depressed skull fractures are classified as open or closed, depending on the integrity of the overlying scalp. Although basilar skull fractures can occur at any point in the base of the skull, the typical location is in the petrous portion of the temporal bone. Findings associated with a basilar skull fracture include hemotympanum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea or rhinorrhea, periorbital ecchymosis ('raccoon eyes'), and retroauricular ecchymosis (Battle's sign).

# Cerebral Contusion and Intracerebral Hemorrhage

Common locations for contusions are the frontal poles, the subfrontal cortex, and the temporal lobes. Contusions may occur directly under the site of  impact  or  on  the  contralateral  side  (contrecoup  lesion).  The  contused area  is  usually  hemorrhagic  with  surrounding  edema,  and  occasionally associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neurologic dysfunction may be profound  and  prolonged,  with  patients  demonstrating  mental  confusion, obtundation, or coma. Focal neurologic deficits are usually present.

# Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage

This  condition  results  from  the  disruption  of  subarachnoid  vessels  and presents with blood in the CSF. Patients may complain of diffuse headache, nausea, or photophobia. Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage may be the most common CT abnormality in patients with moderate or severe TBI. Some cases may be missed if the CT scan is obtained less than 6 hours after injury.

--- Page 902 ---

882 SECTION 18: Trauma

# Epidural Hematoma

An epidural hematoma results from an acute collection of blood between the inner table of the skull and the dura mater. It is typically associated with a skull fracture that lacerates a meningeal artery, most commonly the middle meningeal artery. Underlying injury to the brain may not necessarily be severe. In the classic scenario, the patient experiences loss of consciousness after a head injury. The patient may present to the ED with clear mentation, signifying  the  'lucid  interval,'  and  then  begin  to  develop  mental  status deterioration in the ED. A fixed and dilated pupil on the side of the lesion with contralateral hemiparesis is a classic late finding. The high-pressure arterial  bleeding  of  an  epidural  hematoma  can  lead  to  herniation  within hours of injury. An epidural hematoma appears biconvex on CT scan.

# Subdural Hematoma

A subdural hematoma (SDH), which is a collection of venous blood between the dura matter and the arachnoid, results from tears of the bridging veins that extend from the subarachnoid space to the dural venous sinuses. A common  mechanism  is  sudden  acceleration-deceleration.  Patients  with  brain atrophy, such as in alcoholics or the elderly, are more susceptible to a SDH. In  acute  SDH,  patients  present  within  14  days  of  the  injury,  and  most become symptomatic within 24 hours of injury. After 2 weeks, patients are defined as having a chronic SDH. Symptoms may range from a headache to lethargy or coma. It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic SDHs by history, physical examination, and CT scan. An acute SDH appears as a hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesion that crosses suture lines.

# Herniation

Diffusely or focally increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can result in herniation of the brain at several locations. Transtentorial (uncal) herniation occurs when a SDH or temporal lobe mass forces the ipsilateral uncus of the temporal lobe through the tentorial hiatus into the space between the cerebral  peduncle  and  the  tentorium.  This  results  in  compression  of  the oculomotor  nerve  and  parasympathetic  paralysis  of  the  ipsilateral  pupil, causing it to become fixed and dilated. When the cerebral peduncle is further compressed, it results in contralateral motor paralysis. The increased ICP and brainstem compression result in progressive deterioration in the level of consciousness. Occasionally, the contralateral cerebral peduncle is forced against the free edge of the tentorium on the opposite side, resulting in paralysis ipsilateral to the lesion-a false localizing sign. Central transtentorial herniation occurs with midline lesions in the frontal or occipital lobes, or in the vertex. Bilateral pinpoint pupils, bilateral Babinski signs, and  increased  muscle  tone  are  found  initially,  which  eventually  develop into  fixed  midpoint  pupils,  prolonged  hyperventilation,  and  decorticate posturing. Cerebellotonsillar  herniation through  the  foramen  magnum occurs much less frequently. Medullary compression causes flaccid paralysis, bradycardia, respiratory arrest, and sudden death.

# Penetrating Injuries

Gunshot  wounds  and  penetrating  sharp  objects  can  result  in  penetrating injury  to  the  brain.  The  degree  of  neurologic  injury  will  depend  on  the

--- Page 903 ---

SECTION 18: Trauma

Approximately 8% of patients suffering a severe TBI will have an associated cervical spine fracture. Obtain imaging studies of the cervical spine on all trauma patients who present with altered mental status, neck pain, intoxication, neurologic deficit, severe distracting injury, or if the mechanism of injury is  deemed serious enough to potentially produce cervical spine injury.

Laboratory  work  should  include  type  and  crossmatching,  complete blood  count,  basic  metabolic  panel,  arterial  blood  gas  analysis,  directed toxicologic studies, and coagulation studies.

Spine  and  spinal  cord  injuries  (SCIs)  can  be  devastating,  life-changing events  that  include  injury  to  the  bony  elements  (vertebral  fracture),  the neural elements (spinal cord and nerve root injury), or both.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The spinal cord is most commonly injured by a direct mechanical cause, with resultant hemorrhage, edema, and ischemia. Patients may complain of neck and back pain, and close examination may note pain or bony abnormalities  with  palpation.  Unstable  spinal  fractures  may  present  without obvious spinal cord or nerve root trauma. Symptomatic patients may complain  of  paresthesias,  dysesthesias,  weakness,  bowel  or  bladder  incontinence,  urinary  retention,  or  other  sensory  disturbances  with  or  without specific physical examination findings. More severely injured patients may have obvious neurologic deficits.

Complete spinal cord lesions are characterized by the absence of sensory and motor function below the level of injury (Figs. 161-1 and 161-2).

Incomplete lesions have a better prognosis, and denote some degree of neurologic  activity  below  the  injury,  but  their  initial  diagnosis  may  be obscured because of spinal shock. Spinal shock is  the  temporary loss or depression of spinal reflex activity below the level of injury to the spinal cord. Spinal shock can persist for days to weeks and prohibit the differentiation of an incomplete and complete lesion (Table 161-1).

Neurogenic shock refers to the loss of sympathetic innervation leading to relative bradycardia and hypotension. Hemorrhage must be excluded as the explanation for hypotension before neurogenic shock is considered. The presence of neurogenic shock may necessitate inotropic support.

Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) is an entity seen most often in the pediatric population. Numbness, paresthesias, or other neurologic complaints with normal plain radiographs or CT should prompt further evaluation with MRI.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Consider an injury to the spine or spinal cord in any patient with an appropriate traumatic mechanism. Suspect SCI with any neurologic complaints, even if transitory. A complete neurologic examination should include motor strength and tone (corticospinal tract), pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tract), proprioception and vibration sensation (dorsal columns), reflexes, perianal sensation and wink, and bulbocavernosus reflex. 'Sacral sparing' denotes preservation of reflexes and an incomplete SCI.

Validated clinical guidelines exist to identify patients who may benefit from cervical spine imaging. The NEXUS (Tables 161-2) and the Canadian Cervical Spine Rule for Radiography (Table 161-3) are intended for alert, stable adult patients.

886

CHAPTER 161: Spine Trauma

887

High-resolution  CT  is  more  sensitive  and  specific  for  cervical  spine fractures  than  plain  films,  and  is  the  modality  of  choice  at  most  trauma centers for suspected cervical spine injuries. For plain radiography of the cervical spine, at least three views (lateral, odontoid, and anteroposterior) are necessary.

Both CT and plain radiography can miss purely ligamentous injuries. Sensitivity  is  not  high  enough  to  rely  on  flexion-extension  films.  When ligamentous injury is suspected, reliable patients can be discharged with a firm  foam  collar  for  follow-up  in  3  to  5  days  with  a  spine  surgeon.

Severe facial injuries are associated with injuries to the brain, orbit, cervical spine, and lungs. After stabilization of life-threatening injuries during the primary survey, a thorough secondary survey should identify facial injuries that  could  affect  the  patient's  normal  appearance,  vision,  smell,  mastication, and sensation.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

A thorough history should begin with questions directed toward whether the patient has vision changes, malocclusion, or facial numbness (Table 162-1). The physical examination begins with inspection, noting facial asymmetry, facial elongation, exophthalmos or enophthalmos, and periorbital or mastoid ecchymosis. Next, palpate the entire face, noting step-offs and tenderness that  suggest  fractures,  and  crepitus  that  suggests  a  sinus  fracture.  Finally, perform a focused and thorough examination of the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth, as described in Table 162-1.

Eye

Examine early before swelling of lids, or use retractors. Document visual acuity. Fat through eyelid wound indicates an orbital septum perforation. Widening of the distance between the medial canthi, or telecanthus, suggests serious nasoethmoidal-orbital complex trauma. Widening of the distance between the pupils, or hypertelorism, results from orbital dislocation and often is associated with blindness. Examine extraocular muscle movements. Limited upward gaze occurs with entrapment of the inferior rectus or inferior oblique muscles, or damage to the oculomotor nerve. Systematically examine the eye. Specifically, the pupil for teardrop sign pointing to globe rupture, the anterior chamber for hyphema, and swinging flashlight test for afferent papillary defect. Perform a fluoroscein test for corneal abrasions or ulcers. Check intraocular pressure for evidence of orbital compartment syndrome only in absence of globe injury.

# Nose

Crepitus over any facial sinus suggests sinus fracture.

Septal hematoma appears as blue, boggy swelling on nasal septum. Should be incised and drained to avoid a saddle nose deformity.

# Ears

Auricular hematomas should be incised and drained to avoid a cauliflower deformity. Cerebrospinal fluid leak, auditory canal lacerations, and hemotympanum suggest basilar skull fracture.

# Oral

Jaw deviation due to mandible dislocation or condyle fracture. Malocclusion occurs in mandible, zygomatic, and Le Fort fractures.

Assess for missing or injured teeth.

Lacerations and mucosal ecchymosis suggest mandible fracture.

Place finger in external ear while the patient gently opens and closes jaw to detect condyle fractures.

Tongue blade test: Patient without fracture can bite down on a tongue blade enough to break blade twisted by examiner.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Diagnosis of many maxillofacial injuries is made clinically and with radiographs. Plain films are helpful if CT is not available or to screen for injuries in low-risk patients. Facial CT is frequently required to make the definitive diagnosis  and  guide  surgical  management.  Imaging  recommendations based on suspected injury sites and pretest clinical suspicion are summarized in Table 162-2.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

During the primary survey of facial trauma patients, the airway must be secured and stabilized as clinically indicated. When endotracheal intubation is required, the orotracheal route is preferred over the nasotracheal route because of concern for nasocranial intubation, worsening of injury, and severe epistaxis. While rapid sequence intubation is the preferred method of  airway  management in trauma, always plan for a difficult airway in patients with facial trauma. To prevent the 'can't intubate/can't oxygenate'  failed  airway,  do  not  administer  paralytics  unless  a  patient  can  be bagged  effectively  or  alternative  airway  devices  or  plans  are  in  place.

Awake intubation with sedation and local airway anesthesia may allow the emergency physician to determine the feasibility of orotracheal intubation while still preserving a patient's airway reflexes. When endotracheal intubation appears impossible or is unsuccessful, perform emergent cricothyroidotomy to secure the airway. The laryngeal mask airway may be used as a temporizing measure, but it does not protect the airway from aspiration  of  stomach  contents  and  may  not  be  possible  with  injuries involving the pharynx.

Severe midfacial and mandibular injuries can result in substantial hemorrhage  from  the  sphenopalatine  and  greater  palatine  branches  of  the external  carotid  artery.  Posterior  nasal  epistaxis  can  be  controlled  with nasal  tampons,  dual  balloon  devices,  or  Foley  catheter  placement  with layered gauze packing anteriorly, again being careful to avoid intracranial placement in severe midfacial fractures. Rarely, reduction of significantly displaced  nasal  fractures  and  Le  Fort  injuries  is  needed  to  stop  arterial bleeding.  If  bleeding  persists,  immediate  operative  intervention  may  be required to ligate injured vessels. Alternatively, arterial embolization may be pursued to control bleeding from branches of the external carotid artery.

Management decisions will be dictated by the location and severity of the facial fractures, as well as concurrent injuries. Typically patients with sinus fractures should receive oral or intravenous antibiotics, such as firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Frontal  sinus  fractures are  uncommon,  and  increase  the  immediate risk of traumatic brain injury, additional facial fractures, and cervical spine injury due to the amount of force needed to fracture the thick frontal bone. Because  the  dura  is  adherent  to  the  posterior  table  of  the  frontal  sinus, operative repair of through-and-through frontal sinus fractures is necessary to prevent pneumocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and infection. Patients with depressed fractures also require admission for IV antibiotics and operative repair. Patients with isolated anterior table fractures of the frontal sinus may be discharged with appropriate follow-up with a facial surgeon.

Naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures result  from  significant  trauma  to  the nasal bridge, and often have associated injury to the lacrimal duct, dural

tears,  and  traumatic  brain  injury.  Patients  with  these  fractures  require admission for specialty consultation with facial surgery and neurosurgery.

Orbital blowout fractures occur when a blunt object strikes the globe, transmitting force through the fluid-filled eye, and fracturing the medial or inferior  orbital  wall.  Surgery  may  be  required  if  these  injuries  result  in extraocular muscle or oculomotor nerve entrapment, or significant enophthalmos. A fracture involving the superior orbital fissure can damage the oculomotor and ophthalmic divisions of the trigeminal nerve (the 'orbital fissure syndrome'), and can involve the optic nerve as well (the 'orbital apex syndrome'). Patients with either of these syndromes require emergent ophthalmologic consultation. All other patients with isolated orbital fractures can be managed expediently as an outpatient with oral amoxicillinclavulanate ,  decongestants,  and  instructions  to  avoid  nose  blowing  until the  defect  has  been  repaired.  Emergent  ophthalmological  consultation should be requested for ocular injury associated with orbital fractures. An ocular compartment syndrome may occur with a retrobulbar hematoma or malignant  orbital  emphysema  which  can  cause  an  acute  ischemic  optic neuropathy.

Zygoma fractures occur  in  two  major  patterns:  tripod  fractures  and isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Tripod fractures involve disruption of the infraorbital rim, the zygomaticofrontal suture, and the zygomaticotemporal  junction.  These  fractures  require  admission  for  IV  antibiotics  and surgical repair. Patients with isolated fractures of the zygomatic arch may have elective outpatient repair.

Midfacial  fractures are  high-energy  injuries  and  are  often  seen  in victims  of  multisystem  trauma.  Patients  frequently  require  endotracheal intubation  for  airway  control.  Oral  packing  is  often  required  for  hemorrhage control with fractures of the hard palate. Le Fort injury patterns are illustrated in Figure 162-1. Visual acuity should be tested, especially with Le Fort III and IV fractures, in which the incidence of blindness is around

3% most commonly secondary to injury of the optic nerve. Both Le Fort II and III injuries can result in CSF leaks. Le Fort injuries require admission for management of significant associated injuries, IV antibiotics, and surgical repair.

Mandible fractures are often diagnosed in the setting of malocclusion and pain with attempted movement. Always look for multiple mandibular fractures, with one injury at the site of impact and a second subtle injury on the opposite side of the ring. A careful intraoral examination is important to exclude small breaks in the mucosa seen with open fractures, sublingual hematomas,  and  dental  or  alveolar  ridge  fractures.  Patients  with  closed fractures may be given urgent outpatient follow-up, while open fractures require admission for IV antibiotics and operative repair. In the patient with a stable airway, a Barton bandage, an ace wrap over the top of the head and underneath the mandible, will stabilize the fracture and help relieve pain.

Neck trauma causes a diverse combination of injuries because of the high concentration  of  critical  structures  in  the  neck.  Presenting  signs  of  neck injury may be obvious, subtle, or obscured by trauma to other body regions. Missed injuries and delays in diagnosis lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Historical and physical examination findings of vascular, laryngotracheal, or pharynoesophageal injury of the neck are characterized as hard or soft signs (Table 163-1), with 90% of patients with hard signs having an injury requiring emergent repair.

Vascular  injuries  are  the  most  common  cervical  injury  and  cause  of death from penetrating neck trauma. Symptoms include frank exsanguination  and  expanding  hematomas,  which  may  cause  airway  obstruction. Cervical  artery  injury  can  also  cause  various  vascular  and  neurological signs and symptoms (Table 163-2).

# Table 163-2 Compiled Screening Criteria for Blunt Cerebral Vascular Injury

Laryngotracheal injuries can present with immediate signs of impending airway obstruction (Table 163-3) or have an insidious onset of airway compromise after a quiescent phase.

Pharyngeal  and  esophageal  injuries  have  no  hard  signs  of  injury  and may initially present with few symptoms.

Neurologic injuries can result from injury to the cervical spine, spinal cord, lower cranial nerves, or brachial plexus. Symptoms can range from sensory complaints to quadriplegia.

Strangulation is a type of blunt neck injury whose presentation largely depends on the duration and degree of vascular compression rather than on airway  obstruction.  Cerebral  anoxia,  laryngotracheal  fractures,  cervical spine fractures, pharyngeal lacerations, and carotid artery injuries are possible. The most common symptoms are neck pain, voice changes, trouble swallowing, and difficulty breathing, while common signs are petechiae and neck contusions. However, 50% of patients have no signs of trauma and 67% are asymptomatic. Some patients with ultimately life-threatening injuries are asymptomatic at presentation.

# DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The zone classification summarizes structures placed at risk for injury in penetrating neck trauma (Fig. 163-1). Zone I structures include the lung apices, thoracic vessels, distal trachea, esophagus, cervical spine, and vertebral and carotid arteries. Zone II structures include the mid-carotid and vertebral arteries, jugular veins, esophagus, cervical spine, larynx, and trachea. Zone III structures include the proximal carotid and vertebral arteries, oropharynx, and cervical spine.

In penetrating neck trauma, a careful, structured physical exam is > 95% sensitive for clinically significant vascular and aerodigestive injuries. Particular attention should be paid to whether the platysma has been violated. If violation has occurred, the presence of deep structure injury is assumed until  proven  otherwise.  The  combination  of  physical  examination  with multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) (100% sensitive and 97.5% specific  for  significant  vascular  or  aerodigestive  injury)  has  been  recommended over mandatory operative exploration and selective management strategies  for  diagnosis  in  stable  patients.  Additional  studies  may  be required  if  MDCTA  detects  a  penetrating  injury,  but  these  are  typically ordered in conjunction with the specialist who will be repairing the suspected injury. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of penetrating neck injuries is shown in Fig. 163-2.

Safely managing blunt neck trauma victims requires a heightened level of suspicion and an aggressive approach to diagnosis because catastrophic injuries can present subtly. Therefore, MDCTA should be used liberally. If the  MDCTA  is  negative,  but  significant  suspicion  of  vascular  injury remains,  formal  cerebral  angiography  may  be  required.  Likewise,  if  a strong suspicion of blunt laryngotracheal or esophageal injury remains after

# Cardiothoracic Injuries

Bedside diagnosis and immediate intervention by the emergency provider may be lifesaving for significant injuries associated with severe chest trauma such as tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade. Initial resuscitation and airway management should follow established principles, as discussed in Chapter 156, 'Trauma in Adults.' It is important to avoid hypoxia and hypotension to prevent secondary injury in head-injured patients. In the hemodynamically unstable, polytrauma patient who requires emergency surgery  without  CT  imaging, exclude  immediate  life  threats  rapidly  at  the bedside using ultrasound , radiographs, and physical examination.

Physical examination should include assessment for visible trauma to the  chest  wall  including  any  'seat  belt  sign,'  focal  areas  of  tenderness, subcutaneous  emphysema,  and  open  chest  wounds.  Tracheal  deviation, unequal chest rise, abnormal breath sounds, and bowel sounds in the chest are less frequent but also important to note. Consider endotracheal intubation for patients in respiratory distress (Table 164-1).

# ■ LUNG INJURIES

Tension pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space, either by escaping  from  damaged  lung,  tracheobronchial  tissue,  or  an  open  chest wound.  The  pneumothorax  may  become  pressurized  during  respiration causing  tension  with  resultant  respiratory  and  circulatory  compromise. Patients  may  have  dyspnea,  tachycardia,  hypotension,  distended  neck veins, tracheal deviation, and unequal breath sounds. Recognize and treat tension pneumothorax immediately with needle decompression without waiting for radiographs. Insert a 14-G, 4.5-cm over-the-needle catheter in the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line (a standard 14-G IV catheter may not reach the pleural space in many patients). A rush of air through the catheter is confirmatory. Leave the catheter in until a chest tube can be inserted, as the catheter converts the tension pneumothorax to an open pneumothorax.

Treat a small pneumothorax with inpatient observation ; tube thoracostomy may not be necessary. Treat a large pneumothorax with tube thoracostomy (24 to 28 F (8.0 to 9.3 mm)). Patients with pneumothoraces

of any size and those with subcutaneous emphysema (requiring presumption of  an  occult  pneumothorax)  who  will  be  intubated  or  who  will  be  transported by air should receive a tube thoracostomy, as positive pressure ventilation and decreased barometric pressure can cause expansion of trapped air and progression to a tension pneumothorax. Never clamp a chest tube, but always place it on water seal when taken off suction. See Table 164-2 for causes of failure of the lung to fully reinflate after tube thoracostomy.

Treat a hemothorax with tube thoracostomy . A 32- to 40-F (10.7 to 13.4 mm) chest tube has historically been used but the larger size may not be necessary. Indications for surgery include an immediate return of 1 L of blood or ongoing bleeding of 150 to 200 mL/h for 2 to 4 hours. Consider using a heparinized autotransfusion device if massive hemothorax is suspected but do not delay tube thoracostomy.

Pulmonary contusions are direct injuries to the lung parenchyma without laceration. Hypoxia develops as bleeding and edema compromise contused lung tissue. Seventy percent of pulmonary contusions are not immediately visible  on  initial  chest  radiograph,  but  may  appear  as  patchy  opacities, typically within 6 hours. CT scan is much more sensitive. Initial management should include pain control to prevent hypoventilation, avoidance of unnecessary IV fluids to prevent pulmonary edema, and strict pulmonary toilet. Administer  crystalloids  judiciously  to  maintain  perfusion and use blood products early in resuscitation. A trial of positive pressure ventilation by mask is reasonable in a patient with normal mental status who requires limited respiratory support. Patients with involvement of > 25% of lung tissue will likely require intubation, but should not be intubated preemptively. If intubated, use positive-end expiratory pressure. Use diuretics if the patient is thought to have volume overload.

# ■ ChESt WaLL INJURIES

A small open chest wound can progress to a tension pneumothorax through a one-way valve effect. Cover the wound with sterile petroleum gauze taped on three sides to allow air to exit but not enter. Perform tube thoracostomy but not through the wound.

Flail chest occurs when a section of ribs fractures in multiple locations, causing instability of a segment of the chest wall. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation will stabilize the flail segment. Surgical fixation may be needed, although the greater danger is the underlying lung contusion that compromises respiration.

Rib fractures  may suggest other injuries  or  cause  morbidity  independently. Fractures of the first and second ribs require great force and should therefore cause high suspicion for other major thoracic injuries including myocardial, vascular, and bronchial injuries. Multiple lower rib fractures

--- Page 925 ---

CHAPTER 164: Cardiothoracic Injuries

905

should raise suspicion for liver or splenic injuries. The focus of diagnostic imaging  is  to  exclude  other  injuries  such  as  pneumothorax,  pulmonary contusion, and intraabdominal injury.

Even in  the  absence  of  coexisting  injury,  the  pain  of  rib  fractures may eventually lead to splinting, ventilatory compromise, and pneumonia. Consider intercostal nerve blocks and epidural anesthesia for pain control. Patients being discharged should generally receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  opioid  analgesics.  Remind them  to  breathe  deeply  or  perform  incentive  spirometry  exercises. Admit patients with multiple fractures, medical comorbidities, or older age for a period of observation until they are stabilized on a regimen of pain control and pulmonary toilet. Do not attempt to stabilize the chest wall  with  tape  or  binding. Assess  patients  with  a  sternal  fracture  for cardiac  injury  by  ECG,  serial  troponin  measurements,  and  cardiac monitoring.

Assume patients with subcutaneous emphysema have a pneumothorax even if not seen on the initial chest radiograph. Supine chest radiograph is a relatively insensitive screening tool for pneumothorax and for hemothoraces of < 200 mL. Up to 1000 mL may appear as only diffuse haziness. Lung collapse from intubation of a mainstem bronchus can have a similar appearance.  If  the  patient  can  safely  sit  up,  upright  and  expiratory  views  can increase sensitivity. Ultrasound has been shown to have good sensitivity for pneumothorax, with loss of the sliding pleura sign while a hemothorax will  show  fluid  in  the  dependent  portion  of  the  chest. CT  scan  is highly sensitive for both of these conditions. If subclavian venous cannulation is attempted, it should be done on the side of the suspected injury so that an iatrogenic pneumothorax does not result in bilateral pneumothoraces.

Penetrating wounds should never be deeply probed. A small stab wound may develop into a delayed pneumothorax; repeat the ultrasound or chest radiograph at 4 to 6 hours after the initial presentation.

# ■ PNEUMOMEDIaStINUM aND tRaChEOBRONChIaL INJURIES

Pneumomediastinum is most often caused by ruptured alveoli with dissection of air to the mediastinum and does not require treatment in the asymptomatic patient. Coughing, heavy breathing (such as seen in drug inhalation), or exertion can rupture alveoli and release air into the mediastinum. However, pneumomediastinum can also be the result of injuries to the trachea and  large  airways  from  high  energy  or  major  deceleration.  Dyspnea, hemoptysis, subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, a crunching sound with the  cardiac  cycle,  and  a  massive  continued  air  leak  through  a  chest  tube suggest tracheobronchial injury.

# ■ DIaPhRaGMatIC INJURIES

All penetrating injuries from the level of the nipples to the umbilicus have the potential to injure the diaphragm. Small lacerations can be asymptomatic and then progress to the rupture of abdominal contents into the chest weeks to months later. The diagnosis is obvious if imaging shows herniation of abdominal contents into the chest or coiling of a gastric tube within

--- Page 926 ---

906 SECTION 18: Trauma

the chest. Subtle abnormalities may also be seen on chest radiograph, CT, or upper GI series with contrast. Laparotomy and laparoscopy remain the gold standards to exclude diaphragmatic injuries. All diaphragmatic lacerations require surgical repair.

# ■ PENEtRatING CaRDIaC INJURIES

The  right  ventricle  is  the  most  commonly  injured  portion  of  the  heart because of its large anterior exposure. Accumulation of blood in the pericardial  space  compresses  the  heart,  which  prevents  diastolic  filling.  The diagnosis  is  typically  made  by  bedside  ultrasound.  Pericardiocentesis should  only  be  attempted  for  a  patient  in  shock  with  confirmed  cardiac tamponade since it is technically difficult and may result in laceration of a coronary artery or injury to the myocardium. Stable patients should have a pericardial window or thoracotomy performed in the operating room.

Patients with penetrating chest injuries with signs of life in the field but who subsequently become pulseless may be candidates for ED thoracotomy. Relieving cardiac tamponade, controlling hilar bleeding, cross clamping the descending aorta, or repairing a myocardial laceration may be lifesaving. Stab wounds to the heart are more likely to be amenable to repair than injuries from gunshot wounds. Once the chest is opened, the heart is delivered from  the  pericardium  so  that  potential  injuries  can  be  visualized.  Direct digital pressure, staples, sutures, or a Foley catheter with inflated balloon may be used to temporize bleeding lacerations on the way to the operating room for definitive repair.

# ■ BLUNt INJURIES tO thE hEaRt

Blunt cardiac injury can lead to death from damage to cardiac structures, coronary artery injury and thrombosis, and contusion of the myocardium resulting in impaired contractility and arrhythmias. ECG changes consistent with ischemia suggest coronary artery dissection or thrombosis, which are evaluated and treated by cardiac catheterization and stenting. A direct blow to the chest such as when a young athlete is struck by a hard ball can induce ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest even without myocardial injury (commotio cordis). Treat according to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithms because there is usually no structural damage to the heart.

A patient with cardiac injury may present with chest pain, tachycardia unexplained by hemorrhage, and arrhythmias. Bedside echocardiography by the emergency provider should be performed as a first screen for cardiac tamponade and grossly impaired contractility. Treat tamponade the same as tamponade from penetrating cardiac injury .  Patients with hypotension not explained by another cause, arrhythmias, and impaired contractility should undergo further evaluation by formal echocardiography and cardiac enzymes,  with  transesophageal  echocardiogram  being  three  times  more sensitive  than  transthoracic  echocardiogram  for  blunt  myocardial  injury. Give antiarrhythmic  and  inotropic  medications  according  to ACLS  algorithms. Indications for admission include abnormalities on echocardiogram, ECG, or cardiac enzymes. Discharge patients with normal vital signs, normal initial ECG, no underlying cardiac disease, and age < 55 years after 4 to 6 hours of normal cardiac monitoring.

# ■ tRaUMa tO thE GREat VESSELS

Trauma to  the  major  thoracic  vessels  is  often  lethal,  with  90%  of  those sustaining blunt aortic injury dying at the scene. The most common site of blunt  aortic  injury  is  at  the  proximal  descending  aorta  between  the  left subclavian artery and the ligamentum arteriosum. Injury to the subclavian and innominate arteries can be related to shoulder belts, fractures of the first and  second  ribs,  and  proximal  clavicle.  Half  of  patients  present  without external physical findings, so suspicion for this injury needs to be high with mechanisms involving high-speed deceleration.

Table  164-3  shows  radiographic  findings  of  thoracic  aortic  injury, although a normal chest radiograph does not exclude major vascular injury. All the patients with a mechanism highly concerning for great vessel injury should undergo CT angiogram with IV contrast. Conventional aortography is still used in some cases to assess injuries and guide operative planning. Transesophageal  echocardiogram  is  useful  for  diagnosing  aortic  intimal lesions, but is contraindicated in airway compromise or suspected cervical spinal injury.

Indications  for  immediate  operation  for  vascular  injury  are  hemodynamic instability, radiographic evidence of a rapidly expanding hematoma, or  large-volume  chest  tube  output.  Control  hypertension  in  order  to decrease shear stress on the vessel wall by titration of narcotic pain medications  and  sedatives.  A  short-acting β -blocker,  such  as esmolol ,  may  be titrated to a systolic blood pressure of 100 to 120 mm Hg and a heart rate above 60 beats/min. If bradycardia prevents further dosing of a β -blocker, infuse an arterial dilator such as sodium nitroprusside . Do not use sodium nitroprusside without a β -blocker secondary to the reflex tachycardia that may develop.

Penetrating and occasionally blunt trauma may cause injury to the thoracic esophagus. If suspected, evaluate the patient by esophagram with watersoluble  contrast,  which  is  less  likely  to  cause  mediastinitis.  A  negative study with water-soluble contrast should be followed by the use of barium contrast, which has a higher sensitivity for injury. Flexible esophagoscopy is an alternative modality for assessing injury. Delayed diagnosis of esophageal injury has a high mortality if mediastinitis ensues. Injuries to the area of  the  left  proximal  subclavian  vein  may  result  in  chylothorax,  causing delayed pleural effusion with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. Initial treatment is chest tube insertion .

Patients may develop chest pain, fever, and a friction rub 2 to 4 weeks after  cardiac  trauma  or  surgery  which  may  indicate  pericarditis.  ECG may  show  diffuse  ST-segment  elevation  consistent  with  pericarditis. Pericardial and pleural effusions may be seen on echocardiography and chest  radiograph,  respectively. Treatment  is  with  nonsteroidal  antiinflammatory medications .

# Abdominal Injuries

O. John Ma

The  primary  goal  in  the  evaluation  of  abdominal  trauma  is  to  promptly recognize conditions that require immediate surgical exploration. The most critical error is to delay operative intervention when it is needed.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

# Solid Organ Injuries

Injury to the solid organs causes morbidity and mortality, primarily as a result of acute blood loss. An increase in pulse pressure may be the only clue to loss of ≤ 15% of total blood volume. As blood loss continues, heart and  respiratory  rate  increase.  Hypotension  may  not  occur  until  a  30% decrease in circulating volume occurs. The spleen is the most frequently injured organ in blunt abdominal trauma and is commonly associated with other intra-abdominal injuries. The liver also is commonly injured in blunt and penetrating injuries. Kehr sign, representing referred left shoulder pain, is  a  classic  finding  in  splenic  rupture.  Lower  left  rib  fractures  should heighten  clinical  suspicion  for  splenic  injury.  Some  patients  with  solid organ injury occasionally present with minimal symptoms and nonspecific findings  on  physical  examination.  This  is  commonly  seen  in  younger patients  and  those  with  distracting  injuries,  head  injury,  or  intoxication. Serial  physical  examinations  on  an  awake,  alert,  and  reliable  patient  are important for identifying intra-abdominal injuries.

# Hollow Visceral Injuries

These injuries produce symptoms by the combination of blood loss and peritoneal  contamination.  Perforation  of  the  stomach,  small  bowel,  or colon  is  accompanied  by  blood  loss  from  a  concomitant  mesenteric injury. Gastrointestinal contamination will produce peritoneal signs over time. Patients with head injury, distracting injuries, or intoxication may not exhibit peritoneal signs initially.

Small bowel and colon injuries are most frequently the result of penetrating trauma. However, a deceleration injury can cause a bucket-handle tear  of  the  mesentery  or  a  blow-out  injury  of  the  antimesenteric  border. Suppurative peritonitis may develop from small bowel and colonic injuries. Inflammation may take 6 to 8 hours to develop.

# Retroperitoneal Injuries

The  diagnosis  of  retroperitoneal  injuries  can  be  challenging.  Signs  and symptoms may be subtle or absent at initial presentation. Duodenal injuries most often are associated with high-speed vertical or horizontal decelerating trauma. These injuries may range in severity from an intramural hematoma  to  an  extensive  crush  or  laceration.  Duodenal  ruptures  are  usually contained within the retroperitoneum. Clinical signs of duodenal injury are often  slow  to  develop.  Patients  may  present  with  abdominal  pain,  fever,

909

--- Page 930 ---

910 SECTION 18: Trauma

nausea, and vomiting, although these symptoms may take hours to become clinically apparent.

Pancreatic  injury  often  accompanies  rapid  deceleration  injury  or  a severe  crush  injury.  Unrestrained  drivers  who  hit  the  steering  column  or bicyclists who fall against a handlebar are at risk for pancreatic injuries. Pancreatic injuries can present with subtle signs and symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive.

# Diaphragmatic Injuries

Presentation of diaphragm injuries is often insidious. Only occasionally is the diagnosis obvious when bowel sounds can be auscultated in the thoracic cavity. Herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity or a nasogastric tube coiled in the thorax confirms the diagnosis on chest radiograph. In most cases, however, the only finding on chest radiograph is blurring of the diaphragm or an effusion.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

# Plain Radiographs

A chest radiograph is helpful in evaluating for herniated abdominal contents in the thoracic cavity and for evidence of free air under the diaphragm. An  anteroposterior  pelvis  radiograph  is  important  for  identifying  pelvic fractures, which can produce significant blood loss and be associated with intra-abdominal injury.

# Ultrasonography

The focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination (Table 165-1) is a widely accepted primary diagnostic study. The underlying premise of the FAST exam is that many clinically significant injuries will  be  associated  with  free  intraperitoneal  fluid.  The  greatest  benefit  of

CHAPTER 165: Abdominal Injuries

FAST is the rapid identification of free intraperitoneal fluid in the hypotensive patient with blunt abdominal trauma. Since the FAST examination can reliably detect small amounts of free intraperitoneal fluid and can estimate the  rate  of  hemorrhage  through  serial  examinations,  it  has  essentially replaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) for blunt abdominal trauma in the majority of North American trauma centers.

# Computed Tomography

Abdominopelvic CT with IV contrast (Table 165-2) is the noninvasive gold standard study for the diagnosis of abdominal injury (unless the patient has an allergy to iodinated contrast). The addition of PO contrast is too timeconsuming to be practical in trauma management. The major advantage of IV  contrast  CT  over  other  diagnostic  modalities  is  that  the  precise location(s) and grade of injury can be identified. CT can quantify and differentiate the amount and type of free fluid in the abdomen. Because CT can evaluate for retroperitoneal injuries, it is the ideal study for assessment of the duodenum and pancreas. The use of multiphasic CT (arterial, portal, and  equilibrium  phases)  accurately  identifies  life-threatening  mesenteric hemorrhage and transmural bowel injuries.

# Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage

The  wide  availability  of  CT  and  ED  ultrasound  has  relegated  DPL (Table  165-3)  to  a  second-line  screening  test  for  evaluating  abdominal

trauma. For blunt trauma, indications for DPL include (a) patients who are too hemodynamically unstable to leave the ED for CT and (b) unexplained hypotension in patients with an equivocal physical examination. DPL is considered positive if more than 10 mL of gross blood is aspirated immediately, the red blood cell count is higher than 100,000 cells/mm 3 , the white blood cell count is higher than 500 cells/mm 3 , bile is present, or if vegetable matter is present.

The only absolute contraindication to DPL is when surgical management is clearly indicated, in which case the DPL would delay patient transport to the operating room. Relative contraindications include patients with advanced hepatic dysfunction, severe coagulopathies, previous abdominal surgeries, or a gravid uterus.

Challenges  in  evaluating  penetrating  trauma  to  the  flank  and  buttocks include recognizing peritoneal and retroperitoneal injuries and determining which patients need immediate surgery and which can be managed more conservatively. Trajectories and resultant severity and pattern of injury can vary widely with both stab and gunshot wounds. Hemodynamically unstable patients need immediate operative intervention. Mechanism and time of injury,  weapon  characteristics,  and  determining  the  bullet  path  or  stab wound depth may also assist in determining the initial diagnostic approach if the patient is otherwise stable.

# ■ PENETRATING FLANK TRAUMA

# Clinical Features

Presentation may vary from stable vital signs with an innocuous-appearing wound  to  hemodynamic  shock  and  peritonitis.  Gross  blood  on  rectal examination suggests bowel injury. Blood at the urethral meatus or hematuria suggests genitourinary injury.

# Diagnosis and Differential

CT  imaging  is  the  diagnostic  modality  of  choice  for  hemodynamically stable patients. Protocols vary by institution, but may include PO or rectal contrast if there is suspicion for hollow viscous injury. Contrast-enhanced CT can also often help determine stab wound depth. Bedside ultrasound (eFAST exam) can be used to assess for intraabdominal free fluid and thus help predict the need for surgical intervention.

CHAPTER 166: Penetrating Trauma to The Flank and Buttocks 915

# ■ PENETRATING BUTTOCK TRAUMA

# Clinical Features

Gunshot  wounds  are  much  more  likely  to  require  laparotomy  than  stab wounds.  Gunshot  wounds  above  the  level  of  the  greater  trochanter  and gross hematuria predict the need for surgery. Rectal examination to assess for  gross  blood,  evaluation  of  lower  extremity  pulses,  and  neurologic examination  to  assess  for  sciatic  and  femoral  nerve  injury  should  be performed.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Hemodynamically  stable  patients  should  undergo  CT  with  oral,  IV,  and rectal  contrast  (to  avoid  missed  colon  and  rectal  injuries).  Cystourethrogram  should  be  performed  on  patients  with  findings  of  hematuria  or wounds near the genitourinary tract. CT angiography or traditional angiography and venography may be indicated if a pelvic hematoma is found on CT.  Bedside  ultrasound  (eFAST  exam)  can  also  be  used  to  assess  for intraabdominal  free  fluid  and  thus  help  predict  the  need  for  surgical intervention.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Genitourinary (GU) injuries frequently occur in the setting of polytrauma, so a thorough evaluation is necessary to avoid missing significant injuries.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Injuries should be suspected with any blunt or penetrating trauma near the GU tract, including any rapid deceleration, which can cause major vascular or parenchymal injury even without specific signs or symptoms. Hematuria of any amount raises the index of suspicion for GU injury, and difficulty with urination can be due to bladder or urethral injury or associated concomitant spinal cord injury. Flank contusions or hematomas, evidence of lower  rib  fractures,  or  penetrating  flank  injuries  raise  concern  for  renal injury.  Lower  abdominal  pain,  tenderness,  ecchymosis,  or  evidence  of  a pelvic fracture as well as perineal or scrotal edema are consistent with possible  bladder  injury.  Vaginal  bleeding,  a  high-riding  prostate,  a  perineal hematoma, and/or blood at the urethral meatus are concerning for urethral disruption.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

There is  no  direct  relationship  between  the  degree  of  hematuria  and  the severity of renal injury. There is some evidence that microscopic hematuria in patients with a blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or any gross hematuria is associated  with  a  more  significant  renal  injury.  In  children  where  renal trauma is being considered, isolated microscopic hematuria with < 50 red blood  cells  per  high-powered  field  makes  a  significant  renal  injury  less likely. An IV contrast-enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT scan is the imaging 'gold  standard'  for  the  stable  trauma  patient  with  a  suspected  kidney injury. A 10-minute delayed image is needed to ascertain whether there is any urine extravasation but can be omitted if the kidney is normal and there are no fluid collections. A retrograde cystogram (plain film or CT) is the 'gold standard' for demonstrating bladder injury, and a retrograde urethrogram is indicated for demonstrating urethral injuries. Color Doppler ultrasonography  is  the  preferred  imaging  technique  for  investigating  closed scrotal  and  testicular  injuries. A  focused  assessment  with  sonography  in trauma  (FAST)  exam  can  detect  intra-abdominal  fluid  collections  but cannot reliably evaluate renal, bladder, or ureteral injuries Table 167-1.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

Take a standardized approach to all multiple trauma patients to identify and treat life-threatening injuries (primary survey) and then perform a thorough secondary  survey,  including  a  GU  examination,  to  diagnose  all  injuries. Obtain appropriate diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing as indicated by the initial history and examination.

# ■ MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC INJURIES

# Kidney

Kidney  injuries  include  contusions,  hematomas,  lacerations,  and  completely shattered kidneys with or without vascular injuries. Eighty percent of patients with kidney injury have additional visceral or skeletal injuries that complicate their management. Most renal injuries are handled nonoperatively,  but  indications  for  operative  treatment  include  life-threatening bleeding  from  the  kidney;  expanding,  pulsatile,  or  non-contained  hematoma (thought to be from an avulsion injury); renal avulsion injury; and extravasation from the renal pelvis or from a ureteral injury. There are little data to support specific treatment recommendations for patients with isolated renal trauma. Patients with microscopic hematuria and no indication for  imaging  can  be  discharged  home  with  instructions  for  no  strenuous activity and follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat urinalysis. Those with a contusion (normal imaging and microscopic hematuria) can be discharged as above. Those with a higher-grade injury and/or gross hematuria should be admitted for observation (to include repeat hematocrit and urinalysis), hydration,  and  rest  until  gross  hematuria  clears,  or  general  improvement ensues.

# Ureter

Ureteral  injuries  are  almost  always  due  to  iatrogenic  complications  of instrumentation or penetrating trauma. Notably the absence of hematuria does not exclude an injury. In a stable patient a delayed CT scan of the

--- Page 938 ---

918 SECTION 18: Trauma

abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast can identify ureteral injuries. If the CT scan is non-diagnostic and there is a high concern for an injury then an IV pyelogram or retrograde pyelogram is indicated. Treatment is operative, including stenting in some cases.

# bladder

Bladder injuries occur in about 2% of blunt abdominal trauma patients and 80% are  associated  with  pelvic  fractures.  Gross  hematuria  is  present  in about  95%  of  patients  with  significant  injury  and  warrants  a  retrograde cystogram.  Bladder  injuries  can  also  be  present  in  pelvic  fractures  with only the presence of microscopic hematuria but the degree of microscopic hematuria  warranting  a  cystogram  is  unclear.  Extraperitoneal  rupture  is most  common  and  can  usually  be  treated  by  bladder  catheter  drainage alone.  Intraperitoneal  rupture  always  requires  surgical  exploration  and repair. A retrograde cystogram can be performed by infusing ~350 ml of contrast material to distend the bladder. Passive bladder filling is not sensitive enough to exclude a bladder rupture. Sonographic diagnosis of a bladder injury is not accurate.

# Urethra

Posterior urethral injuries (membranous and prostatic urethra) are typically related to major blunt force trauma and are associated with pelvic fractures.  Treatment  is  via  suprapubic  bladder  drainage  followed  by surgical repair in several weeks. Because a urinary catheter can disrupt a partial posterior urethral injury, one should not be placed if there is suspicion of injury without first obtaining a retrograde urethrogram. Anterior urethral injuries usually occur due to direct trauma such as from a straddle  injury  or  a  direct  blow  to  the  bulbar  or  penile  urethra.  The absence of hematuria does not rule-out a urethral injury. If there is concern for an injury, then avoid placing a foley catheter and obtain a retrograde urethrogram by injecting 20 to 30 mL of contrast into the urethra and obtain a radiograph. If a foley catheter has already been placed, then a 16-gauge angiocatheter can be used to inject contrast between the catheter and urethra. Treatment is supportive, which may include a urinary catheter.  Penetrating  trauma  to  the  anterior  urethra  generally  requires operative repair.

# Testicles and Scrotum

Evaluate blunt testicular trauma with an ultrasound examination. If testicular rupture is present, exploration and repair is indicated. If the testicle is intact, conservative treatment with ice, elevation, scrotal support, and pain medication is appropriate. Hematomas and hematoceles are managed on a case-by-case basis. Penetrating testicular trauma warrants surgical exploration  and  repair.  Scrotal  lacerations  can  be  directly  repaired  and  scrotal avulsions require surgical repair with the testicle covered in the remaining scrotum.

# Penis

Simple contusions are managed conservatively with cold packs, rest, and pain medications. Simple lacerations involving skin only can be directly

repaired,  but  deeper  lacerations  and/or  penetrating  injuries  require operative exploration and repair. Amputation requires microsurgical reimplantation  if  the  amputated  segment  is  viable.  Penile  fractures  require exploration and repair.

# Trauma to The Extremities

Amy M. Stubbs

Isolated penetrating trauma to the extremities that is associated with vascular injury has a nearly 10% incidence of mortality or limb loss. Early identification  of  injuries  requiring  imaging  and/or  surgical  intervention  has reduced the rates of limb loss and disability.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

As with all traumatic injuries, a thorough primary survey with attention to life-threatening injuries should be accomplished prior to a detailed extremity  exam.  Direct  pressure  or  a  tourniquet  should  be  applied  to  actively bleeding injuries. Once an extremity injury is identified, a meticulous vascular and neuromuscular exam should then be performed.

Note pulses distal to the injury, capillary refill, and the color and temperature of the limb. Use a Doppler to detect a signal in the absence of a pulse. Any 'hard' signs of arterial injury should prompt immediate surgical consultation and intervention. Soft signs of arterial injury should also be noted  and  require  further  evaluation,  typically  imaging  and  observation (Table 168-1).

Document  the  size  and  shape  of  each  wound,  as  well  as  any  bony deformities or soft tissue defects. Evaluate the surrounding area for pain with palpation or range of motion. Carefully evaluate joints in the proximity  of  the  wound  for  the  possibility  of  an  open  joint.  Perform  detailed strength and sensory exams on the affected limb to check for peripheral nerve injury. Consult the appropriate surgical specialist for signs of injury to an artery, nerve, joint, or bone, or suspicion of compartment syndrome (see Fig. 168-1).

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Obtain ankle-brachial indexes (ABIs) on the affected and unaffected limb using a Doppler and manual blood pressure cuff. Though they have variable sensitivity and specificity for arterial injury and do not reliably detect nonocclusive injuries such as intimal flaps or pseudoaneurysms, a result of < 0.9 is concerning for arterial injury. Soft signs of vascular injury or an abnormal ABI requires further imaging.

At minimum, AP and lateral films of the affected limb are necessary to evaluate for bone or joint injuries. Retained foreign bodies or embolized bullet  fragments may also be seen. Image the joint above and below the injury site.

CT angiography has largely supplanted conventional angiography in the evaluation  of  vascular  injuries  as  it  is  widely  available,  rapid,  relatively noninvasive, and provides high-quality images that may also be useful in evaluating  concurrent  injuries.  Ultrasound  is  neither  as  sensitive  nor  as specific as angiography and cannot reliably rule out a vascular injury.

Laboratory testing is not required, though a CBC, type and screen, or creatinine may be indicated in certain settings, such as when there is profuse bleeding or concern exists for renal insufficiency when angiography is a consideration.

# Initial Evaluation and Management of Orthopedic Injuries

Gregory M. Johnston

Orthopedic injuries have implications beyond localized pain and swelling at the site of injury. The clinician must methodically evaluate the patient to prevent missing an occult or concomitant injury. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are needed to prevent prolonged pain, temporary or permanent disability, or even death.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Key to any emergency department encounter is obtaining a concise history from the patient and, when this is not feasible, from pre-hospital personnel or family members, and performing a meticulous physical examination. For instance, a patient may present with a deformed lower extremity, but a history of a fall from height will cue the clinician to consider the possibility of a concomitant spinal injury, or the spontaneous occurrence of a fracture in a patient with a history of malignancy may indicate a pathologic fracture. The clinician should conduct systematic palpation, since it is not uncommon for the  pain  of  a  fracture  or  dislocation  to  be  referred  to  another  area.  Other essential aspects of the physical examination include inspection for swelling, discoloration, and deformity, documentation of both active and passive range of motion proximal and distal to the reported injury, and assessment of neurovascular status to include sensorimotor testing of peripheral nerve function. Vascular status should be assessed as soon as possible, since rapid correction of circulatory compromise can prevent ischemia, tissue loss, or amputation.

Diagnostic  imaging  should  not  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  physical examination, since it is possible for an occult fracture to escape detection on initial radiographic imaging. In addition, some fractures may only be detected on specialized radiographic views. If a patient has significant tenderness to  palpation,  pain  with  weight  bearing,  or  with  passive  range  of motion, then the possibility of an occult fracture should be considered. A negative  plain  film  report  does  not  exclude  a  significant  injury.  In  such instances  the  fracture  may  only  be  detected  by  more  advanced  imaging modalities such as CT, bone scan, or MRI.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Consider obtaining studies of joints above and below the suspected fracture site, since additional injuries may be present. Pediatric patients present a special challenge due to the presence of ossifying growth centers. If a fracture is suspected, it is often helpful to obtain comparison films of the unaffected  side.  While  many  injuries  may  be  treated  in  the  emergency department  and  then  routinely  referred  for  outpatient  follow-up,  more significant  injuries  mandate  immediate  discussion  with  the  orthopedic surgeon.  Digital  imaging  is  becoming  more  common,  so  it  is  often possible  for  the  consulting  orthopedist  to  conduct  a  contemporaneous review of the diagnostic studies when consulted by the emergency physician.  This  is  not  always  feasible  in  rural  medical  facilities  or  military environments; therefore, overreliance on technology should not supplant the fundamental skill of describing radiographs. The following is a recommended way to verbally describe the fracture to the consultant in order to best communicate the findings of the radiograph:

# ■ HAND INJURIES

The hand is innervated by the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Motor function of the median nerve can be screened by flexing the thumb distal phalanx  against  resistance,  the  ulnar  nerve  by  spreading  the  fingers  against resistance, and the radial nerve by maintaining extension of the finger MCP joints against resistance. Sensory innervation (Fig. 170-1) is best screened by  the  presence  of  normal  two-point  discrimination  ( < 5  mm).  Injuries requiring hand surgery consultation are listed in Tables 170-1 and 170-2.

Tendon injuries can be easily missed. Up to 90% of a tendon can be lacerated with preserved range of motion without resistance, so test function against resistance and compare to the uninjured side. Pain along the course of the tendon suggests a partial laceration even if strength is normal. Although extensor tendon repair has often been performed by the emergency  physician,  there  is  a  movement  toward  operative  repair.  Flexor tendon repair should be performed by the hand surgeon. It is acceptable to stabilize the injury by closing the skin and splinting until definitive repair by the hand surgeon. Follow-up and rehabilitation of all tendon injuries are necessary, even those not requiring repair.

Mallet finger results when complete rupture of the extensor tendon occurs at the level of the distal phalanx. On examination, the distal interphalangeal  (DIP)  joint  is  flexed  at  40°.  Splint  the  DIP  joint  in  slight hyperextension.

Boutonniere deformity results from an injury at the dorsal surface of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint that disrupts the extensor hood apparatus. Lateral bands of the extensor mechanism become flexors of the PIP  joint  and  hyperextensors  of  the  DIP  joint.  Splint  the  PIP  joint  in extension.

DIP joint dislocations are uncommon because of the firm attachment of skin and fibrous tissue to underlying bone. Dislocations are usually dorsal. Reduction is performed under digital block anesthesia. The dislocated phalanx  is  distracted  using  longitudinal  traction,  slightly  hyperextended, then repositioned. Splint the joint in full extension. An irreducible joint may be from an entrapped volar plate, profundus tendon, or avulsion fracture.

PIP joint dislocations are usually dorsal with rupture of the volar plate. Closed reduction is as described above for the DIP joint. Splint the joint in 30° flexion. Lateral dislocation results from rupture of one of the collateral ligaments. An irreducible joint or evidence of complete ligamentous disruption warrants surgical intervention.

Metacarpal phalangeal (MCP) joint dislocations are  usually  dorsal and  require  surgical  reduction  due  to  volar  plate  entrapment.  Attempt closed reduction with the wrist flexed and pressure applied to the proximal phalanx in a distal and volar direction. Splint with the MCP joint in flexion.

Thumb IP joint dislocations usually involve volar plate rupture and are often open. Closed reduction is as described above for the DIP joint. Place in a splint with 15° to 20° of flexion.

Thumb MCP dislocations are  usually  dorsal  and  involve  volar  plate rupture.  Reduce  by  flexing  and  abducting  the  metacarpal  and  apply pressure directed distally to the base of the proximal phalanx. Place in a thumb spica splint.

--- Page 951 ---

CHAPTER 170: Hand and Wrist Injuries

931

Thumb  MCP  ulnar  collateral  ligament  rupture (gamekeeper's  or skier's thumb) results from forced radial abduction at the MCP joint, with the rupture occurring at the insertion on the proximal phalanx. The joint capsule and volar plate are usually involved. A complete tear is diagnosed when abduction stress on the proximal phalanx causes more than 30° to 35° of radial angulation relative to the metacarpal. Place in a thumb spica splint. Complete tears mandate surgical referral.

Distal phalanx fractures most commonly involve the tuft. These are associated with nail bed laceration. Place a volar or hairpin splint to the DIP joint.  Avulsion  fractures  of  the  base  often  represent  associated  tendon involvement.

Proximal and middle phalanx fractures of the base and neck that are nondisplaced and stable can be treated with buddy taping. Transverse or spiral  midshaft  fractures  or  intraarticular  fractures  often  require  surgical fixation. Place a gutter splint with the MCP joint flexed at 70°, the IP joints in extension.

Metacarpal (MC) fractures most commonly involve the fourth or fifth MC neck (boxer's fracture). Skin lacerations over the fracture should raise concern for a 'fight bite.' Angulation more than 20° in the fourth MC, 40° in the fifth MC, or 15° in the second or third MC should be reduced. Place an ulnar gutter splint for fractures of the fourth or fifth MC and a radial gutter splint for fractures of the second or third MC with the wrist extended at  20°  and  the  MCP  joint  flexed  at  70°.  Thumb  MC  fractures  usually involve  the  base  with  intraarticular  involvement  (Bennett  and  Rolando fractures). Place in a thumb spica splint.

Compartment syndrome of the hand may result from crush injury or extravasation of IV fluids or radiocontrast media. The patient will complain of pain that is out of proportion to exam findings. On examination, the hand, at a resting position, is extended at the MCP joint and slightly flexed at the PIP joint. There is tense edema and pain with passive stretch of  the  involved  compartment.  This  is  an  orthopedic  emergency  and  the diagnosis  is  made  clinically  due  to  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  accurate compartment pressures.

High-pressure injection injury occurs when substances in a high pressure device ( > 2000 psi), such as grease, paint, or hydraulic fluid, are injected into the hand. Oil-based paint causes a severe tissue reaction that can result in  ischemia  and  eventual  need  for  amputation.  Obtain  hand  and  forearm radiographs  searching  for  radiopaque  substances  and  subcutaneous  air. While it appears benign, this injury requires emergent surgical evaluation.

# ■ WRISt INJURIES

Scapholunate dissociation presents with wrist tenderness and swelling at the scapholunate joint. The PA radiograph demonstrates a space between the scaphoid and lunate that is > 3 mm. Treat with a radial gutter splint and prompt referral.

Perilunate  and  lunate  dislocations are  best  noted  on  lateral  wrist radiograph.  In  both  injuries,  the  normal  alignment  of  the  radius-lunatecapitate (the '3 C's' sign) is lost. With a perilunate dislocation, the lunate remains  aligned  with  the  radius,  but  the  carpals  are  dislocated,  usually dorsal to the lunate. With a lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates volar to

the radius, but the remainder of the carpus aligns with the radius. Lunate dislocation on PA radiograph has a triangular shape, the 'piece of pie' sign, and on lateral view, the 'spilled teacup' sign. Emergent consult for closed reduction or surgical repair is indicated.

Carpal  bone  fractures are  managed  as  summarized  in  Table  170-3. The scaphoid is the most common carpal bone fractured. Fracture of the scaphoid,  lunate,  or  capitate  can  cause  avascular  necrosis  of  the  bone. Scaphoid and lunate fractures are often not detected on plain radiographs, so ED diagnosis and treatment should be based on clinical findings alone.

Colles,  Smith,  and  Barton fractures involve  the  distal  radius  at  the metaphysis  (Table  170-4).  Most  of  these  fractures  can  be  treated  with closed reduction and a sugar-tong splint.

Radial styloid fracture can produce carpal instability with scapholunate dissociation as major carpal ligaments insert here. Splint the wrist in mild flexion and ulnar deviation.

# ■ SOFT TISSUE INJURIES

# Biceps and Triceps Tendon Ruptures

# Clinical Features

Patients with proximal long-head biceps tendon ruptures typically describe a 'snap' or 'pop' and complain of pain in the anterior shoulder. Examination reveals tenderness, swelling, and crepitus over the bicipital groove in the  anterior  shoulder.  A  mid-arm  'ball'  (the  distally  retracted  biceps) appears when the elbow is flexed. Elbow flexion strength is maintained due to the preserved action of the brachialis and supinators. This is in contrast to distal biceps tendon rupture where elbow flexion and supination is weak. Examination of distal biceps rupture reveals swelling, ecchymosis, tenderness, and inability to palpate the tendon in the antecubital fossa. With the patient seated, the elbow flexed 60 to 80 degrees, and forearm resting on the patient's lap, the examiner squeezes the muscle belly of the biceps causing the forearm to supinate (biceps squeeze test). If no supination is noted, then this is a positive test indicating a distal biceps tendon rupture. Triceps tendon ruptures are rare, and the majority occur distally. Patients present with pain, swelling, and tenderness proximal to the olecranon; a sulcus with a proximal mass (the proximally retracted triceps tendon) may be palpable. Forearm  extension  is  weak.  A  modified  Thompson  test  can  be  used  to assess triceps function. With the arm supported, elbow flexed at 90 degrees, and forearm hanging in a relaxed position, squeezing the triceps muscle should produce extension of the forearm unless a complete tear is present.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis is clinical. Obtain radiographs to exclude an associated avulsion fracture.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment includes sling, ice, analgesics, and referral to an orthopedic surgeon  for  definitive  management.  Complete  tendon  tears  in  young  active individuals often require surgical repair.

# Overuse Syndromes

# Clinical Features

Lateral  epicondylitis  or  "tennis  elbow"  is  more  common  than  medial epicondylitis or "golfer's elbow." Lateral epicondylitis affects the forearm and wrist extensors, and medial epicondylitis affects the forearm and wrist flexors. Patients with medial epicondylitis may develop an ulnar neuropathy. Both  syndromes  result  from  repetitive  activity  involving  these  muscle groups.

934

--- Page 955 ---

CHAPTER 171: Forearm and Elbow Injuries

935

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis  is  clinical.  Radiographs  may  help  in  ruling  out  an  associated avulsion fracture of the lateral or medial epicondyle.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Management is conservative including rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications,  and  bracing.  Occupational  therapy  can  be  useful  in  treating  these syndromes. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases.

# ■ ELBOW DISLOCaTIONS

# Clinical Features

The majority of elbow dislocations are posterolateral and often occur as a result of a fall on an outstretched hand. On examination, the patient holds the elbow in 45 degrees of flexion. Significant swelling of the elbow often obscures  the  olecranon,  which  is  directed  posteriorly.  Neurovascular assessment  is  essential  (Table  171-1).  An  open  dislocation,  absence  of radial pulse before reduction, and presence of systemic injuries are all factors associated with arterial injury.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Radiographs confirm the diagnosis. The lateral view reveals both the ulna and radius displaced posterior. The AP view reveals either medial or lateral displacement of the ulna and radius with maintenance of their normal relationship to each other. The presence of associated fractures, especially to the radial head and coronoid process, can render the elbow joint unstable and complicate treatment.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The goals of treatment are reduction with procedural sedation and recognition  of  neurovascular  complications,  associated  fractures,  and  postreduction  instability.  Intra-articular  lidocaine  may  provide  analgesia  for closed reduction.

Apply firm pressure with thumbs to push the  olecranon  over  the  trochlea  and  back  into  position.  The  singleperson  method  (Fig.  171-3)  starts  with  the  patient  prone  and  the affected arm on the stretcher with the elbow flexed over the edge of the stretcher. Place a pillow or folded blanket under the humerus and hang a 5-lb weight to the wrist. The elbow should spontaneously reduce over several minutes. Gentle pressure to the olecranon can aid the reduction.

SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

# ■ ELBOW FRaCTURES

# Clinical Features

Radial head fractures present with pain, swelling, and tenderness over the lateral elbow, and inability to fully extend the elbow. Supracondylar and intercondylar fractures present with significant swelling, tenderness, and limited  range  of  motion  at  the  elbow.  Supracondylar  fractures  may resemble a posterior elbow dislocation. Olecranon fractures present with pain,  swelling,  and  crepitus  over  the  posterior  elbow.  Epicondyle,  condyle, trochlear, capitellum, and coronoid fractures are uncommon and can occur in association with other elbow injuries such as dislocations. An Essex-Lopresti lesion, a radial head fracture with associated distal radioulnar joint dissociation, presents with wrist and forearm pain in addition to lateral elbow pain. A neurovascular assessment is essential in all elbow fractures. Potential complications of supracondylar fractures are numerous  (Table  171-2).  A  decreased  or  absent  radial  pulse  is  common  in children and often secondary to brachial artery injury, even if the hand appears  warm  and  perfused.  Signs  of  Volkmann  ischemic  contracture

--- [END OF TABLE] ---

(compartment syndrome of the forearm) include refusal to open the hand, pain  with  passive  extension  of  the  fingers,  and  forearm  tenderness. Absence of radial pulse alone does not constitute ischemia unless accompanied by these other signs.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Fracture lines may not be visible on standard AP and lateral radiographs of the elbow. Abnormal fat pads, a visible posterior fat pad, or a prominent anterior fat pad ('sail sign') may be the only evidence of injury. Disruption of the radiocapitellar line may be another clue to injury. A line drawn from the center of the radial shaft should transect the radial head and capitellum in all views. On the lateral view, a line drawn along the anterior cortex of the humerus (anterior humeral line) should transect the posterior two-thirds of  the  capitellum.  If  the  anterior  humeral  line  transects  the  anterior  onethird of the capitellum, then this is suggestive of a distal humerus or supracondylar  fracture.  CT  imaging  can  be  considered  for  certain  elbow fractures, such as coronoid or comminuted intra-articular fractures.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Immobilization  in  a  splint  and  orthopedic  referral  are  appropriate  for nondisplaced fractures. Nondisplaced radial head fractures with no mobility restrictions are treated with sling immobilization. Immediate orthopedic consultation is warranted for all displaced fractures, open fractures, and  evidence  of  neurovascular  compromise.  Admit  patients  who  have displaced fractures with significant swelling for observation of neurovascular status.

# ■ FOREaRM FRaCTURES

# Clinical Features

Both bone forearm fractures present with swelling, tenderness, and deformity of the forearm. Isolated ulna or radius fractures present with localized swelling and tenderness. Monteggia fracture-dislocation, a fracture of the proximal  third  of  the  ulna  with  a  radial  head  dislocation,  presents  with significant pain and swelling over the elbow. Galeazzi fracture-dislocation, a  fracture  of  the  distal  radius  with  an  associated  distal  radioulnar  joint

--- Page 960 ---

940

SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

dislocation, presents with localized tenderness and swelling over the distal radius and wrist.

# Diagnosis and Differential

AP and lateral radiographs confirm the diagnosis. In a Monteggia fracture, the radiocapitellar line is disrupted, and the apex of the ulna fracture points in the direction of the radial head dislocation. In a Galeazzi fracture, the distal  radioulnar  joint  space  is  widened  on  the AP  view,  and  the  ulna  is displaced dorsally on the lateral view.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treat  nondisplaced  fractures,  torus  or  greenstick  fractures  with  less  than 15 degrees angulation with long arm splint immobilization and referral to orthopedics.  Immediate  orthopedic  consultation  is  necessary  for  all  displaced fractures. Closed reduction is often adequate for both bone fractures in children. Open reduction and internal fixation are usually required for displaced  fractures  in  adults  and  for  Monteggia  and  Galeazzi  fracturedislocations (Table 171-3).

# ■ STERNOCLAVICULAR SPRAINS AND DISLOCATIONS

# Clinical Features

Patients with simple sprains have pain and tenderness localized to the joint, whereas patients with dislocations have severe pain, which is exacerbated by arm motion and lying supine. In anterior dislocations, the medial clavicle is visibly prominent and palpable anterior to the sternum. In posterior dislocations,  the  medial  clavicle  is  less  visible  and  often  not  palpable. Symptoms of hoarseness, dysphagia, dyspnea, upper extremity paresthesia, or weakness may indicate life-threatening injuries to mediastinal structures, such as pneumothorax or compression or laceration of surrounding great vessels, trachea, and esophagus.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Computed tomography (CT) is the imaging test of choice. However, the contrast may be needed to detect injury to adjacent mediastinal structures. Consider septic arthritis in the nontraumatic patient, especially in injection drug users.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment for sternoclavicular sprains and uncomplicated anterior dislocations includes ice, analgesics, and sling immobilization. Attempted closed reduction is not necessary as this injury is often unstable. Posterior dislocations  require  immediate  orthopedic  consultation  for  open  reduction  and internal fixation.

# ■ CLAVICLE AND SCAPULA FRACTURES

# Clinical Features

Patients with clavicle fractures present with pain, swelling, and tenderness over the clavicle. The scapula is a well-protected bone; therefore, fractures usually occur in association with injuries to the ipsilateral lung, thorax, and shoulder  girdle.  Patients  have  pain  and  localized  tenderness  over  the scapula, hold their arm in adduction, and resist any arm movement.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Routine radiographs may miss some clavicle and scapular fractures. CT can confirm the diagnosis as well as identify any associated pathology.

# Emergency Department and Disposition

The majority of clavicle and scapula fractures can be managed conservatively with sling immobilization, ice, and analgesics. Early range-of-motion exercises are important. Orthopedic consultation is warranted for clavicle

943

fractures that are open, have neurovascular compromise, or have persistent skin tenting. Clavicle fractures that are severely comminuted or displaced may benefit from operative intervention so consider early referral to orthopedics in those instances. Presence of a scapula fracture mandates investigation  for  associated  intrathoracic  injuries.  Displaced  glenoid  articular fractures, angulated glenoid neck fractures, and certain acromial and coracoid fractures may require surgical intervention.

# ■ ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT INJURIES

# Clinical Features

Acromioclavicular joint injuries range from mild sprain to complete disruption of all ligaments that attach the scapula and clavicle. AC joint injuries occur from a direct force to the joint with the arm adducted or from a fall on  the  outstretched  hand  with  an  indirect  force  transmitted  to  the  joint. Classification of these injuries and their physical findings are described in Table 172-1.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Diagnosis  is  clinical. Acromioclavicular  radiographs  can  help  determine the severity of the injury and identify any associated fractures.

--- [END OF TABLE] ---

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment for type I and II injuries includes sling immobilization, rest, ice, and analgesics. Early range-of-motion exercises are recommended at 7 to 14 days post injury. Treatment for type III is controversial, but the trend favors  conservative  management  with  sling  immobilization  rather  than operative management. Treatment for type IV through VI is operative and warrants orthopedic consultation.

# ■ GLENOhUMERAL JOINT DISLOCATION

# Clinical Features

Anterior shoulder dislocations, the most common type of shoulder dislocations,  are  generally  the  result  of  an  abduction,  extension,  and  external rotation force on the arm. Patients present with pain, holding their arm in slight abduction and external rotation. The affected shoulder loses its normal contour. Patients resist any adduction or internal rotation. The humeral head is sometimes palpable anteriorly. Decreased pinprick sensation over the skin of the lateral deltoid is a sign of axillary nerve injury. Posterior shoulder dislocations often result from an indirect, abduction and internal

--- Page 965 ---

CHAPTER 172: Shoulder and Humerus Injuries

945

rotational  force  or  from  a  direct  blow  to  the  anterior  shoulder.  Patients present with pain, anterior flattening of the normal shoulder contour, and prominence  of  the  posterior  shoulder.  Patients  are  unable  to  externally rotate or abduct the affected arm. Inferior shoulder dislocations (luxatio erecta) result from a hyper abduction force. Patients present with their arm completely abducted, elbow flexed, and hand resting on or behind their head.  The  humeral  head  is  palpable  on  the  lateral  chest  wall.  Superior shoulder dislocations are very rare.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Anteroposterior and scapular 'Y' view radiographs confirm the type of dislocation and identify any associated fractures. The presence of minor fractures, such as Hill-Sachs lesions (humeral head defects) or Bankart lesions (glenoid labral defects), does not change ED management. Consider omitting prereduction radiographs in patients, who have a history of recurrent shoulder dislocation, presenting with signs and symptoms of a recurrence in the absence of trauma.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Reduction  techniques  include  traction,  leverage,  and  scapular  manipulation. Be familiar with at least two or three techniques. The most common techniques are detailed below. Procedural sedation is recommended; however, an intraarticular injection of 10 to 20 mL of 1% lidocaine can facilitate reduction and may obviate the need for sedation.

--- Page 966 ---

946 SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

as possible while stabilizing the superior aspect of the scapula with the other hand. A small amount of dorsal displacement of the scapula tip is recommended.

Once reduced, assess neurovascular status and provide sling immobilization in order to maintain the shoulder in adduction and internal rotation. Post reduction radiographs are useful for confirmation and documentation of successful reduction. Urgent orthopedic follow-up is necessary. Complications  include  recurrence,  rotator  cuff  tears,  humeral  head  defects, glenoid labral defects, and neurovascular injuries. Early operative repair may decrease the incidence of recurrence.

# ■ hUMERUS FRACTURES

# Clinical Features

Patients with proximal humeral fractures have pain, swelling, tenderness, ecchymosis, and crepitus about the shoulder. Range of motion is severely limited; patients hold their arm closely against the chest wall. Patients with humeral shaft fractures present with pain, swelling, localized tenderness, limited mobility, and crepitus on palpation. Shortening of the arm can be seen  in  displaced  fractures.  A  careful  neurovascular  exam  is  essential. Injuries to the axillary nerve and artery are common in proximal humerus fractures.  The  radial  nerve  is  most  frequently  injured  in  humeral  shaft fractures  and  manifests  as  weak  wrist  extension,  wrist  drop,  or  altered sensation in the dorsal web space of the thumb index web space.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Radiographs confirm the diagnosis. The Neer classification system divides the proximal humerus into four parts (articular surface of the humeral head, greater tubercle, lesser tubercle, and diaphysis of the humerus) and is used to guide treatment.

--- Page 967 ---

CHAPTER 172: Shoulder and Humerus Injuries

947

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Proximal  humerus  fractures  that  are  nondisplaced  or  one-part  fractures (displaced < 1  cm  or  angulated < 45°)  require  sling  immobilization,  ice, analgesics, and orthopedic referral. Humeral shaft fractures that are nondisplaced require a coaptation splint (sugar tong), hanging cast, or functional bracing. In addition, humeral shaft fractures that have less than 20° angulation in the sagittal plan, less than 30° of varus or valgus deformity, and are shortened less than 2 cm can be managed conservatively. Multipart proximal humeral fractures, significantly displaced or angulated shaft fractures, open fractures, or fractures with neurovascular injuries require immediate orthopedic consultation.

# ■ BRAChIAL PLEXUS INJURIES

# Clinical Features

Traumatic brachial plexus injuries  are  the  most  common  form  of  plexus injuries, often resulting from penetrating, compression, or closed traction mechanisms.  Injuries  can  be  classified  into  supraclavicular  (roots  and trunks) or infraclavicular (cords and terminal nerve) injuries. Patients complain of constant, burning arm pain and will have sensory and motor deficits.  Patients  may  have  significant  swelling  and  soft  tissue  injury  to  the neck and shoulder girdle. Horner's syndrome may be present if the adjacent ganglions  are  damaged.  Unless  the  patient  is  responsive,  the  neurologic impairment is often not appreciated clinically until after the initial stabilization and treatment. Figure 172-1 demonstrates the sensory distributions of the cervical roots and peripheral nerves.

# Diagnosis

Diagnosis  is  largely  clinical.  MRI  and  CT  myelography  are  frequently obtained. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocity studies can aid in the diagnosis. Sometimes surgical exploration is necessary.

--- Page 968 ---

948 SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

The location and extent of nerve damage guides treatment and determines prognosis.  It  is  important  to  be  able  to  recognize  this  injury  and  refer appropriately.

# ■ PELVIC INJURIES

# Clinical Features

Signs and symptoms of pelvic injuries vary from local pain and tenderness to pelvic instability and severe shock. Examine the patient for pain, pelvic instability,  deformities,  lacerations,  ecchymoses,  and  hematomas.  Avoid excessive  movement  of  unstable  fractures  as  this  could  produce  further injury and cause additional blood loss. Rectal examination may reveal displacement  of  the  prostate  or  rectal  injury.  Blood  at  the  urethral  meatus suggests urethral injury. A vaginal speculum examination may be indicated to detect lacerations that would suggest an open fracture. If a pelvic fracture is  found, assume associated intraabdominal, retroperitoneal, gynecologic, or urologic injuries exist until proven otherwise.

# Diagnosis and Differential

In patients with a suspected pelvic fracture, obtain a standard anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiograph to evaluate for bony injury. Other radiographic views  include  lateral  views,  AP  views  of  the  hemipelvis,  internal  and external oblique views of the hemipelvis, or inlet and outlet views of the pelvis. CT is superior to pelvic radiographs for identifying pelvic fractures and evaluating pelvic ring instability. Therefore, consider CT if there is a high suspicion for fracture but negative pelvic radiographs. In an unstable blunt trauma patient, use an AP pelvic radiograph to identify a pelvic fracture quickly, allowing for emergent stabilization maneuvers and therapeutic  interventions.  Routine  pelvic  radiographs  are  not  needed  in  stable trauma patients  who  will  undergo  an  emergent  CT  of  the  abdomen  and pelvis.

Pelvic  fractures  include  those  that  involve  a  break  in  the  pelvic  ring, fractures of a single bone without a break in the pelvic ring, and acetabular fractures. Single bone fractures are described in Table 173-1.

Acetabular fractures are commonly associated with lateral compression forces or hip dislocations and can be diagnosed with pelvis radiographs and Judet views. CT is more sensitive than radiography in detecting acetabular injury and is helpful in preoperative planning.

# ■ hIP FRaCtURES

# Clinical Features

The vast majority of hip fractures occur in elderly patients with osteoporosis  or  other  bony  pathology  who  present  after  a  fall  (Table  173-2).  The affected leg is classically shortened and externally rotated. Patients with hip fractures may complain of pain at the site of injury or in the groin and knee. After performing a primary survey and stabilizing the patient, examine the patient for pain, shortening, rotation, deformities, pelvic or sacral tenderness,  and  neurovascular status. If  no  significant  abnormalities  are  found, carefully evaluate range of motion. A history of fall or significant trauma should prompt the examiner to evaluate for other injuries.

to bear weight in patients with normal radiographs should raise suspicion for occult fracture, especially at the femoral neck or acetabulum. MRI is very sensitive (nearly 100%) for identifying occult hip fractures and may identify other sources of pain. CT may be useful in identifying fractures not seen on radiographs,  but  it  is  not  as  sensitive  as  MRI.  The  differential  diagnosis includes pelvic fracture, hip dislocation, femur fracture, sprains, and strains.

SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

# ■ hIP DISLOCatIONS

Hip dislocations may be anterior or posterior, and commonly result from a high-speed  motor  vehicle  crash.  Ninety  percent  of  hip  dislocations  are posterior, and they may be associated with acetabular fractures. On examination, the extremity is shortened, internally rotated, and adducted. With anterior dislocations the extremity is held in abduction and external rotation. Assess the patient's neurovascular status. Obtain radiographs of the hip  and  pelvis  to  evaluate  for  hip  dislocation.  Further  assessment  of  the acetabulum and femur may be done with Judet views or CT.

Hip dislocations are true orthopedic emergencies and should be reduced within  6  hours  because  delays  in  reduction  are  associated  with  a  higher incidence of avascular necrosis. One of the most common methods for hip reduction is described in Figure 173-2. After reduction, gently test range of motion  and  repeat  the  neurovascular  exam.  Order  post-reduction  radiographs or CT to confirm reduction and evaluate for injuries not apparent on initial radiographs. Coordinate post-reduction care with the orthopedist.

CHAPTER 173: Pelvis, Hip, and Femur Injuries

Prosthetic  hips  may  dislocate  relatively  easily  from  minor  trauma  or movements that flex the hip past 90 degrees. It is advisable to discuss the treatment  plan  with  the  consulting  orthopedist  prior  to  any  reduction maneuvers. Most dislocations of prosthetic hips are posterior and can be reduced using the techniques described here.

# ■ FEMORaL ShaFt FRaCtURES

Fractures  of  the  femoral  shaft  occur  most  commonly  in  younger  patients secondary  to  high-energy  trauma.  Pathologic  fractures  can  occur  due  to malignancies.  Clinical  features  include  shortening,  pain,  swelling,  and deformity.  Assess  the  patient  for  neurovascular  status,  signs  of  an  open fracture, and other injuries. ED treatment includes splinting the extremity with a traction splint unless the patient has a sciatic nerve injury, knee injury, vascular injury, or open fracture. Splint without traction if these conditions exist. Open femur fractures require broad-spectrum antibiotics and copious irrigation. Obtain early orthopedic consultation for definitive management.

# ■ FRACTURES

# Clinical Features

Patients  with  patellar  fractures  present  with  focal  tenderness,  swelling, and often a loss of the extensor mechanism. Patients with femoral condyle fractures present with pain, swelling, deformity, rotation, shortening, and an  inability  to  ambulate.  Popliteal  artery  injury,  deep  peroneal  nerve injury, ipsilateral hip dislocation or fracture, and quadriceps mechanism injury  can  be  associated  with  femoral  condyle  fractures.  Tibial  spine fractures present with tenderness, swelling, inability to extend the knee, and a positive Lachman's test. Patients with tibial plateau fractures have pain,  swelling,  and  limited  range  of  motion.  Ligamentous  instability  is present  in  about  one-third  of  these  fractures.  Patients  with  tibial  shaft fractures present with pain, swelling, and crepitance about the knee. Distal tibial fractures involving the articular surface (tibial plafond or Pilon fracture) present with pain, swelling, and tenderness about the ankle. The risk of compartment syndrome is high with tibial fractures and mandates a thorough neurovascular exam. Proximal fibular fractures may be associated with ankle injuries. Patients with isolated fibular shaft fractures may be able to bear weight.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The  Pittsburgh  Knee  Rules  (Fig.  174-1)  or  the  Ottawa  Knee  Rules (Table  174-1)  should  be  used  to  determine  if  radiography  is  needed. These  rules  have  been  validated  in  both  children  and  adults.  In  suspected tibial and fibular injuries, radiographs of the ankle and knee may be necessary to exclude associated fractures. CT scanning may be considered if x-rays are negative, and the patient is unable to bear weight.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Table  174-2  describes  the  mechanism  and  treatment  for  the  various knee fractures. Most tibial fractures require emergent orthopedic consultation. Indications for emergent operative repair include open fractures,  vascular  compromise,  or  compartment syndrome. Patients may be placed in long-leg immobilization and discharged home if they have a low-energy mechanism, have their pain well controlled, and are not at risk for compartment syndrome. Treatment for isolated fibular shaft fractures includes splinting, ice, elevation, and orthopedic or primary care  physician  follow-up.  Proximal  fibular  fractures  associated  with ankle  injuries  require  surgical  intervention  and  urgent  orthopedic consult.

# ■ DISLOCATIONS

# Clinical Features

Patella dislocation results in pain and deformity of the knee. Tearing of the medial knee joint capsule can occur. Knee dislocation results in significant ligamentous and capsular disruption. Spontaneous reduction occurs in 50% of patients. Multidirectional instability of the knee should raise the suspicion for a spontaneously reduced knee dislocation. Knee dislocations have a high incidence of associated injures, such as popliteal artery injury and peroneal nerve injury.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Radiographs may help exclude associated fractures. Some authors recommend  arteriography  for  all  patients  with  confirmed  knee  dislocations. Others advocate for Doppler pressure indices (ankle-brachial index) and serial vascular exams if distal pulses are present, and there are no other signs of vascular injury (including ischemia, hemorrhage, or an expanding hematoma).

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Procedural sedation is recommended to facilitate otherwise painful reductions. For patellar dislocation, flexing the hip and hyperextending the knee help slide the patella back into place. Knee immobilization and orthopedic or  primary care physician follow-up are necessary. For knee dislocation, early  reduction  is  essential  along  with  documentation  of  pre-and  postreduction neurovascular status. Splinting the affected knee in 20 degrees of flexion is essential. Immediate orthopedic and vascular surgery consultation is warranted for all knee dislocations, and admission is mandatory for observation of neurovascular status.

# ■ TENDON, LIGAMENTOUS, AND MENISCAL INJURIES

# Clinical Features

Patients with quadriceps or patellar tendon rupture have pain and swelling about the knee and will not be able to extend the knee against resistance. A palpable defect is present above or below the knee depending on which tendon is involved. Patients with Achilles tendon rupture have severe pain in  the  calf  and  are  unable  to  perform  toe  walk,  run,  or  climb  stairs. A palpable defect is often present in the Achilles tendon 2 to 6 cm above the calcaneus. A positive Thompson test is diagnostic; with the patient lying prone and knee flexed at 90 degrees, the foot fails to plantar flex when the calf  is  squeezed.  Most  ligamentous  injuries  present  with  hemarthroses, though serious ligamentous injuries may present with little pain and no hemarthrosis  due  to  complete  disruption  of  the  capsule.  Patients  with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears often describe a 'pop' and significant swelling over the next several hours after injury. Lachman's test is the most sensitive test for ACL injuries. The anterior drawer and pivot shift test are also useful for diagnosis. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries may result in a positive posterior drawer test; the composite history and  exam  findings,  however,  are  more  accurate  for  diagnosis  of  PCL injury. Medial and lateral collateral ligament injuries are diagnosed with abduction (valgus) and adduction (varus) stress testing in 30 degrees flexion. Laxity greater than 1 cm without a firm end point compared with the other knee is diagnostic for a complete torn medial or lateral collateral ligament. Stress testing should be repeated in extension. If laxity is present  in  extension,  then  this  indicates  injury  to  the  cruciate  ligament  and posterior or posterolateral capsule. Peroneal nerve injury may occur with lateral injuries. Symptoms of meniscal injury include painful locking of the knee, a popping, clicking or snapping sensation, or a sense of instability with activity or joint swelling after activity. McMurray's test and other tests for meniscal injury are not sensitive. Ligamentous injuries may be present as well. A patient with a ''locked knee'' from a torn meniscus will not be able to actively or passively range the affected knee and will have significant pain.

# Diagnosis and Differential

The diagnosis is largely clinical. A high-riding patella may be seen on the lateral radiograph of the knee with patellar tendon rupture. Ultrasound or MRI can help identify Achilles tendon rupture when the diagnosis is not clear. Radiographs are usually normal or show a joint effusion in ligamentous  or  meniscal  injuries.  An  avulsion  fracture  at  the  site  of  the  lateral capsular ligament on the lateral tibial condyle (Segond fracture) is associated with ACL rupture. Outpatient MRI or arthroscopy provides definitive diagnosis.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Treatment of patellar or quadriceps tendon rupture includes knee immobilization and orthopedic consultation for surgical repair, usually within the first  7  to  10  days  after  the  injury.  Treatment  of Achilles  tendon  rupture includes  splinting  in  plantar  flexion,  non-weight-bearing,  and  referral  to

--- Page 980 ---

960

SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

orthopedics  for  possible  surgical  repair.  Treatment  for  ligamentous  and meniscal injuries includes knee immobilization, ice, elevation, analgesics, and orthopedic referral. Treatment for a ''locked knee'' includes analgesia and  closed  reduction.  Procedural  sedation  may  be  necessary.  Place  the patient  supine  with  the  knee  flexed  90  degrees  over  the  side  of  the  bed. Apply longitudinal traction to the knee, and at the same time, apply internal and external rotation to the knee to unlock the joint. Consult orthopedics if the reduction is not successful.

# ■ OVERUSE INJURIES

Patellar tendonitis or 'jumper's knee' presents with pain over the patellar tendon worsened by running up hills, jumping, or standing from a seated position.  Treatment  includes  heat,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs),  and  quadriceps-strengthening  exercises.  Steroid  injections should be avoided. Shin splints and stress fractures can present with pain over the anterior leg. Patients typically describe a change or sudden increase in their training pattern. Patients present with activity-induced pain relieved by rest, which can progress to constant pain. Radiographs are often normal. Discontinuation of the activity for several weeks is the treatment for both shin splints and stress fractures. If a stress fracture is suspected, an outpatient bone scan or MRI can confirm the diagnosis.

# ■ ANKLE INJURIES

# Tendon and Ligament Injuries

# Clinical Features

Tendon  injuries  typically  result  from hyperdorsiflexion (peroneal  tendon injury) or sudden plantarflexion (Achilles tendon injury). Patients with an Achilles tendon rupture complain of severe pain and are unable to walk on their toes, run, or climb stairs. Ligamentous sprains are caused by inversion and eversion injuries. The most common ankle sprain involves the anterior talofibular ligament. Though an isolated sprain of the medial deltoid ligament is rare, it is occasionally associated with a fibular fracture (Maisonneuve fracture) or syndesmotic ligament injury. Any injury with signs of neurovascular compromise requires immediate attention.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Evaluate the ankle as well as the joints above and below the injury. A positive Thompson test (with the patient lying prone and knee flexed at 90°, the foot fails to plantarflex when the calf is squeezed) is diagnostic of Achilles tendon rupture. Palpate the proximal fibula for tenderness resulting from a fracture or fibulotibialis ligament tear. Squeeze the fibula toward the tibia to evaluate for syndesmotic ligament injury. If tenderness is isolated to the posterior aspect of the lateral malleolus, then a peroneal tendon subluxation may be present.

The Ottawa Ankle Rules were developed to help clinicians determine when imaging studies are necessary for patients with ankle injuries (see Fig. 175-1).

Joint stability dictates the treatment plan for an ankle sprain. Instability is usually suspected based on the physical examination and imaging studies. The examiner may perform the anterior drawer and talar tilt tests to assess stability. If the examiner is unable to perform reliable stress testing, the  injury  is  considered  potentially  unstable.  Asymmetry  of  the  gap between the talar dome and the malleoli on the talus x-ray view also suggests joint instability.

SECTION 19: Injuries to the Bones, Joints, and Soft Tissue

Dislocations Posterior dislocations, the most common type of ankle dislocations,  occur  with  a  backward  force  on  the  plantarflexed  foot.  This injury  usually  results  in  the  rupture  of  the  tibiofibular  ligaments  or  a lateral malleolus fracture. Reduce ankle dislocations immediately if vascular compromise (absent pulses or a dusky foot) or skin tenting are present. First, provide analgesia and sedation as needed. Grasp the heel and foot  with  both  hands  and  apply  axial  traction  while  reducing  the  ankle into anatomical alignment. Following successful reduction, assess postreduction  neurovascular  status,  apply  a  splint,  obtain  post-reduction radiographs, and immediately consult orthopedics.

Fractures Ankle  fractures  are  classified  as  unimalleolar,  bimalleolar, and trimalleolar.  Bimalleolar  and  trimalleolar  fractures  require  definitive open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) by an orthopedist. ED care includes initial reduction as needed, posterior splinting, elevation, ice  application,  and  orthopedic  consultation.  Treat  unimalleolar  fractures  with  nonweightbearing  status  and  posterior  splinting.  Manage minimally  displaced  avulsion  fractures  of  the  fibula  ( < 3  mm  in diameter)  like  ankle  sprains.  Ankle  fractures  may  be  occult  and  are occasionally associated with injuries to other parts of the lower extremity (Table 175-1). Patients with open fractures require initial reduction as needed, wet sterile dressing, splinting, tetanus toxoid as necessary, a first generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin 1 g IV, and immediate orthopedic consultation.

# ■ FOOt INJURIES

# Clinical Features

The foot is divided into the hindfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. The Chopart joint separates the hindfoot from the midfoot. The Lisfranc joint separates the midfoot from the forefoot.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Pay  special  attention  on  physical  examination  to  the  base  of  the fifth metatarsal and the base of the second metatarsal. If plain radiographs are nondiagnostic, CT is indicated for suspected Lisfranc joint injuries.

# Hindfoot Injuries

Calcaneal injuries require a large force, and associated injuries are common. Measure Boehler's angle on a lateral radiograph view (formed by the intersection of a line connecting the posterior tuberosity and apex of the posterior facet, and a line from the posterior facet to the apex of the anterior facet) if concerned for a calcaneal compression fracture. An angle < 20° is suggestive of a fracture. Treat with a posterior splint, elevation, analgesics, and orthopedic consultation. Manage small avulsion fractures of the talus with posterior splinting and timely orthopedic follow-up. Subtalar dislocations, as well as major fractures of the talar neck or body, require immediate orthopedic consultation.

# Midfoot Injuries

Injuries of the tarsometatarsal joint combined with pain with midfoot torsion are suspicious for a Lisfranc injury. Lisfranc joint injuries are often

associated with a fracture, most frequently noted at the base of the second metatarsal. A  gap  of > 1  mm  between  the  bases  of  the  first  and  second metatarsal  bones  on  plain  film  is  considered  unstable.  If  standard  radiographs are nondiagnostic, complete workup may require CT imaging. Isolated  navicular,  cuboid,  and  cuneiform  injuries  are  rare  and  treated conservatively.

# Forefoot

Treat nondisplaced metatarsal shaft fractures with a posterior splint or orthopedic shoe. Fractures with greater than 3 to 4 mm displacement on plain films,  however,  require  surgical  reduction.  Treat  pseudo  Jones  fractures (nondisplaced  avulsion  fractures  of  the  tuberosity  of  the  fifth  metatarsal) with a walking cast. Manage true Jones fractures (metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction fracture of the fifth metatarsal) with a nonweightbearing cast and timely orthopedic follow-up for potential surgery. Nondisplaced phalangeal fractures require buddy taping and a stiff-sole (orthopedic) shoe. Treat displaced phalangeal fractures and dislocations with a digital block, reduction by manual traction, and buddy taping. Recommended imaging and care for foot injuries can be found in Table 175-2.

Elevated pressures within a confined muscle compartment can lead to functional and circulatory impairment of that limb. The most common compartments affected are in the lower leg and forearm. This syndrome develops as a result of external compressive forces on a limb or from any  mechanism  that  increases  the  compartmental  size  and  pressure (Table 176-1).

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Severe and difficult-to-control pain, pain out of proportion to examination, and pain with passive stretch of the limb are the hallmark symptoms of this disease. Nerve dysfunction often accompanies the pain and causes burning or dysesthesias in the sensory distribution of the nerve. Motor function can be impaired as well. On exam, the compartment is often swollen, firm, and tender to palpation. Since tissue pressure does not typically exceed arterial pressure, the affected limb often has normal distal pulse, temperature, and color. Symptoms can begin within a few hours after the injury or up to 48 hours after the inciting event.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Diagnosis  is  largely  clinical.  Direct  measurement  of  the  compartment  is necessary when the diagnosis is in question or in patients who are obtunded or sedated. Several commercial devices are available to measure compartment pressures. Normal compartment pressure is < 10 mm Hg. The exact pressure elevation at which cell death occurs is unclear. Pressures between 30 to 50 mm Hg are felt to be detrimental if left untreated for several hours. The diastolic blood pressure minus the measured tissue pressure, or 'delta pressure,' better predicts the potential for irreversible muscle damage. A delta  pressure  of  30  mm  Hg  is  most  commonly  used  to  diagnose  acute

compartment syndrome. Hypotensive patients do not tolerate elevated compartment pressures as well as normotensive patients. The differential diagnosis  for  compartment  syndrome  includes  other  causes  of  pain,  such  as fracture, hematoma, or infection, and other causes of neurologic or vascular compromise.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, surgical fasciotomy is necessary. Admit all patients to the operating room or appropriate inpatient service for observation and serial examinations.

# Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

# Neck and Back Pain

Amy M. Stubbs

Neck and back pain are major causes of disability in the United States and are commonly seen in the ED. While the majority of cases have nonspecific or  benign  etiologies,  serious  underlying  pathology  may  exist.  Clinicians must be vigilant in obtaining a thorough history, focusing on risk factors for pathology,  and  physical  examination  that  includes  a  detailed  neurologic examination.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Neck and back pain have myriad causes, but can often be classified into two  groups:  uncomplicated  musculoskeletal  pain  and  those  with  pain attributable to radiculopathy (spinal nerve root compression) or myelopathy  (spinal  cord  compression)  (see  Tables  177-1,  177-2,  and  177-3). Thoracolumbar  pain  may  also  be  categorized  by  symptom  duration: acute ( < 6 weeks), subacute (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic ( > 12 weeks).

The history should include the onset, circumstances, location, radiation, duration, and exacerbating/alleviating factors of the pain. Historical risk  factors  or  symptoms  concerning  for  serious  pathology  should  be sought (see Table 177-4).

Examination should include evaluation of mobility and range of motion. The patient should be exposed, observing and palpating the neck and back for point tenderness, deformity, lymphadenopathy, or signs of infection. A thorough neurologic examination, including assessment of specific nerve roots'  strength,  sensation,  and  reflexes,  is  essential  (see  Tables  177-2 and  177-3).  Specific  examination  maneuvers  should  be  performed  as indicated for the complaint (see Table 177-5).

A rectal examination evaluating for tone, sensation, and masses is requisite if concern exists for spinal cord compression or other serious pathology.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The differentials  for  neck  and  back  pain  are  broad  but  can  generally  be guided by the history and physical examination. The majority of patients with neck and back pain will not require emergent imaging or diagnostic testing.

SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

Imaging is usually not indicated in cases of acute, nontraumatic neck or back pain without concerning historical features or exam findings. Plain films of the spine have low sensitivity but may be considered as an initial imaging step if clinical suspicions include tumor, fracture, or infection. For patients with pain and neurologic deficits, MRI is the definitive test . CT scan is helpful for identification of disorders of the bony skeleton, but its sensitivity for nerve root or spinal cord disorders is poor. CT myelography can serve as an alternative to MRI, if the latter is contraindicated or unattainable.

Plain  films  or  CT  scan  of  the  cervical  spine  should  be  considered  in patients with chronic neck pain not previously imaged or those with a history  or  trauma,  surgery,  malignancy,  or  rheumatologic  disease.  Flexionextension  films  or  MRI  may  be  considered  if  instability  or  ligamentous injury is suspected. If radiographs are normal, or show only degenerative disease,  and  the  patient  has  a  benign  examination,  no  further  imaging  is required. For patients with back pain, in whom plain thoracic and/or lumbar radiographs are indicated (as discussed above), anteroposterior and lateral views suffice. Careful attention should be paid to end plate erosions, disc space  narrowing,  or  lytic  lesions,  which  are  worrisome  for  infection  or neoplasm. Advanced imaging is necessitated by the presence of neurological deficits or abnormal plain radiographs.

Laboratory testing will  not  be  useful  in  the  majority  of  patients  with neck and back pain. If serious pathology is suspected, a complete blood count,  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR),  and  urinalysis  should  be ordered. ESR has a sensitivity of 90% to 98% for infectious causes of back pain. Urinalysis is useful to rule out urinary or renal pathology as a pain source. Postvoid residual (PVR) assessment, with ultrasound or catheterization, should be performed on patients with complaints or exam findings concerning  for  epidural  compression.  Urinary  retention  is  the  most common finding in cauda equina syndrome, and PVR volume exceeding 500  mL,  alone  or  in  combination  with  other  concerning  findings,  is  an important predictor of MRI-proven cauda equina compression.

Mechanical  disorders,  such  as  strain  caused  by  trauma,  are  often characterized  by  delayed  pain  and  paraspinous  pain  and  stiffness.  See Chapters 161 and 163 for further discussion of traumatic neck and back injuries.

Cervical disc herniation, spondylosis, or stenosis can lead to radiculopathy or  myelopathy.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  radiculopathy  include  pain  and weakness in a dermatomal distribution. Lower extremity hyperreflexia, a positive Babinski sign, and loss of sphincter tone are suspicious for myelopathy; any of these findings necessitate MRI. Metastatic cancer may cause a radiculopathy or myelopathy and should be included in the differential for chronic  pain.  Osteomyelitis,  epidural  abscess,  hematoma,  and  transverse myelitits  may  cause  neck  pain  with  neurologic  deficits,  although  these disorders are more commonly observed in the thoracic or lumbar spine.

Neck pain can be caused by a variety of other disorders such as myofascial  pain  syndrome,  lymphadenopathy,  temporal  arteritis,  ischemic  heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. The distribution of symptoms in these  disorders  will  typically  not  be  dermatomal,  and  other  historical features will usually distinguish them.

The majority of patients with back pain have nonspecific back pain; they have  no  radiculopathy  or  myelopathy  and  no  specific  etiology  is  found.

--- Page 993 ---

CHAPTER 177: Neck and Back Pain

973

These  patients  typically  have  benign  examinations  and  movement  often exacerbates their pain. Diagnostic evaluation is negative.

As  with  neck  pain,  disc  herniation  and  degenerative  changes  of  the thoracic or lumbar spine can be a cause of acute or chronic back pain. More than 95% of disc herniations are at the L4-L5 or L5-S1 nerve roots, compression  of  which  can  cause  sciatica.  These  patients  may  have  leg  pain, neurologic  deficits  localized  to  a  unilateral  nerve  root,  and  a  positive straight-leg test. Spinal nerve root compression can occur at any level in the thoracic  or  lumbar  spine,  with  associated  radicular  symptoms.  Epidural compression  syndromes,  which  include  spinal  cord  compression,  cauda equina syndrome, and conus medullaris syndrome, may cause pain, neurologic  deficits,  or  autonomic  dysfunction  at  any  cord  level.  The  thoracic spine is the most common site of compression due to neoplasm; however, if  suspected, the entire spinal cord should be imaged, as 10% of patients will have additional metastatic lesions.

Infectious  causes  of  back  pain,  including  osteomyelitis,  discitis,  and epidural abscess, are often missed on initial presentation. A high level of suspicion should be maintained in patients with risk factors such as immunocompromise, recent back surgery, retained hardware, or intravenous drug use. Plain films may show bony destruction in patients with osteomyelitis, but x-rays are often initially normal in cases of infectious back pain. MRI is typically required for diagnosis. The ESR will be elevated in the majority of cases.

Other causes of back pain may originate from the spine itself or from nonspinal  causes.  Spinal  stenosis  can  cause  low  back  and  leg  pain  that mimics  claudication,  worsening  with  walking  and  improving  with  rest. Ankylosing spondylitis, an autoimmune arthritis, causes chronic back pain and is identifiable by a characteristic squaring of vertebral bodies on radiography. Transverse myelitis, an inflammatory disorder of the spinal cord, may  mimic  a  compression  syndrome.  Ruptured  abdominal  aneurysm, pyelonephritis,  pancreatitis,  or  renal  infarction  should  be  considered  in patients with nonspecific back pain accompanied by concerning history or exam findings.

Shoulder  pain  is  a  common  musculoskeletal  complaint,  especially  in patients older than 40 years. Occupational, recreational, and normal daily activities stress the shoulder joint and may result in pain from acute injury or, more commonly, chronic overuse conditions. Complicating the evaluation of shoulder pain is that the origin of pain may be from pathology intrinsic to the shoulder joint or from extrinsic disorders causing referred pain.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

The pain of musculoskeletal shoulder pathology often is described by patients as an aching sensation, particularly in the setting of a more chronic process. Nighttime pain is a common feature of intrinsic shoulder pathology. Specific motions may exacerbate it, and this history is helpful in making a specific diagnosis. Decreased range of motion, crepitus, weakness, or muscular atrophy may be associated with certain conditions. Any systemic symptoms such as shortness of breath, fever, or radiation of pain from the chest or abdomen should raise suspicion for extrinsic and potentially life-threatening problems.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The  primary  diagnostic  maneuver  is  a  thorough  history  and  physical examination.  Knowledge  of  shoulder  anatomy  aids  in  identifying  specific injuries (Figs. 178-1 and 178-2). Examination of the shoulder joint

975

SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

should include range of motion and muscle strength testing, palpation for local tenderness or other abnormality, and identification of any neurovascular deficit. Specific tests for impingement and individual tests of rotator cuff muscle function are often helpful in intrinsic disease. Absent significant  trauma,  plain  radiographic  studies  of  the  shoulder  joint  are rarely  diagnostic  but  may  be  helpful  to  exclude  bony  abnormalities  in selected patients or to evaluate for abnormal calcifications. In patients in whom extrinsic causes of shoulder pain are suspected, further diagnostic testing  may  be  indicated,  such  as  laboratory  studies,  additional  radiographs, and an electrocardiogram.

The differential diagnosis includes a variety of intrinsic musculoskeletal disorders, and individual patients may exhibit considerable overlap in their symptoms manifesting a combination of specific conditions. Impingement syndrome is a term that has been adopted to encompass many painful shoulder syndromes that result most frequently from repetitive overhead use of the arm. The pathologic entities included in this syndrome are subacromial  tendonitis  and  bursitis,  supraspinatus  tendonitis,  rotator  cuff tendonitis,  and  the  painful  arc  syndrome.  Impingement  syndrome  is  a painful overuse condition characterized by positive findings with impingement testing and relief of pain with anesthetic injection of the subacromial space. Subacromial  bursitis is  generally  seen  in  patients  younger  than 25 years and will present with positive impingement tests with different degrees of tenderness at the lateral proximal humerus or in the subacromial space. Rotator cuff tendonitis is  distinguished  by  an  incidence  primarily in individuals 25 to 40 years of age and findings of tenderness of the rotator cuff with mild to moderate muscular weakness. In more chronic disease,  crepitus,  decreased  range  of  motion,  and  osteophyte  formation visible on plain radiograph also may be apparent. Rotator cuff tears occur

--- Page 997 ---

CHAPTER 178: Shoulder Pain

977

primarily in patients older than 40 years and are associated with muscular weakness (especially with abduction and external rotation) and cuff tenderness. Ninety percent will be chronic tears with a history of minimal or no trauma; in severe disease, muscular atrophy may be present. Acute tears may occur in patients of any age and result from significant force producing  a  tearing  sensation  with  immediate  pain  and  disability.  In  patients between the ages of  30  and  50  years,  abnormal  calcifications  on  radiograph in the clinical setting of a painful shoulder with rotator cuff tenderness  and  often  crepitus  suggest  the  diagnosis  of  calcific  tendonitis. Osteoarthritis is characteristically associated with degenerative disease in other  joints  (primary)  or  previous  fracture  or  other  underlying  disorder (secondary). The hallmark of adhesive capsulitis is  significantly  painful and limited range of motion often, but not always, associated with a period of  immobilization. Radiographs should be obtained to exclude posterior glenohumeral dislocation. Biceps tendon pathology can also manifest as shoulder pain. The proximal long head of the biceps inserts on the superior aspect of the shoulder. Tendinopathy, subluxation, dislocation, and partial or complete tears can produce pain. Biceps tendinopathy can arise due to inflammation (tendonitis) or collagen tears around the tendon (tendinosis) and may be acute or chronic. Diagnosis is made by palpating the proximal tendon along the bicipital groove or resisted forearm supination. Reproduction of pain by these maneuvers suggests biceps pathology. Tendinitis and  subluxation  can  be  managed  with  sling  immobilization,  analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and frequent ice application, followed by early mobilization.

Other causes of shoulder pain that should be considered are a number of extrinsic conditions. Pancoast tumor may compress the brachial plexus and manifest as shoulder pain. Degenerative disease of the cervical spine, brachial plexus disorders, and suprascapular nerve compression are neurologic  processes  that  should  be  sought  in  patient  evaluation. Vascular pathology, notably axillary artery thrombosis ,  also  may  cause  shoulder pain.  Acute  cardiac,  aortic,  pulmonary,  and  abdominal  pathology  may cause pain referred to the shoulder, and the clinician must remain alert to this possibility.

Hip and knee pain are common complaints, especially among athletes and the obese due to increased forces on their joints. Knee pain is usually due to local pathology, whereas hip pathology commonly causes referred pain in the buttocks and lower extremity and may be due to extraarticular pathology. Each pain has a broad differential diagnosis, but a focused history and physical examination will often lead to the diagnosis (Table 179-1).

# ■ PSOAS ABSCESS

Abscess of the psoas muscle usually occurs through hematogenous spread and may present with abdominal pain radiating to the hip or flank, fever, and limp, or other constitutional symptoms. Eighty percent of the time, it is caused by Staphylococcus aureus . The diagnosis is made by CT. Treatment includes organism-specific antibiotics and surgical drainage .

# ■ REGIONAL NERVE ENTRAPMENT SYNDROMES

Meralgia paresthetica, a compressive inflammation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, causes pain in the hip, thigh, or groin, along with burning or tingling paresthesias, and hypersensitivity to light touch. Address the source of  nerve  irritation  (e.g.,  obesity,  pregnancy,  tight  pants,  belt)  and provide nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat in the ED. Obturator nerve entrapment usually occurs after pelvic fractures, with masses, or in athletes with a fascial band at the distal obturator canal, which causes pain in the groin and down the inner thigh. Surgery may be needed for pain relief. Ilioinguinal nerve entrapment is associated with pregnancy or hypertrophy of the abdominal wall musculature and causes groin pain. Piriformis  syndrome,  irritation  of  the  sciatic  nerve  from  the  piriformis muscle, manifests as pain in the buttocks and hamstring muscles that worsens with sitting, climbing stairs, or squatting. ED treatment is conservative for all of these nerve entrapment syndromes (Table 179-2).

# Table 179-1

# Suggested Clues for the Differential Diagnosis of hip and Knee Pain

Determine the location of the pain to narrow down the potential diagnosis.

Determine the activities that bring on the pain.

Complaints that the joint 'gives out' or 'buckles' generally are due to pain and reflex muscle inhibition rather than an acute neurologic emergency. This complaint may also represent patellar subluxation or ligamentous injury and joint instability.

Poor conditioning or quadriceps weakness generally causes anterior knee pain of the patellofemoral syndrome; therapy should address this weakness.

Locking of the knee suggests a meniscal injury, which may be chronic.

A popping sensation or sound at the onset of pain is reliable for a ligamentous injury.

A recurrent knee effusion after activity suggests a meniscal injury.

Pain at the joint line of the knee (palpable indentation between distal femur and proximal tibia) suggests a meniscal injury.

# ■ BURSAL SYNDROMES OF ThE hIP AND KNEE

Inflamed  or  infected  hip  and  knee  bursae  may  cause  localized  pain. Inflammatory changes may be due to repetitive minor trauma, rheumatologic  disorders  such  as  psoriatic  arthritis,  rheumatoid  arthritis  or ankylosing spondylitis and crystalline disease including gout and pseudogout.  Infection  may  be  difficult  to  distinguish  clinically  from  more benign  disorders;  analysis  of  bursal  aspirate  will  help.  Treatment  is directed at the underlying cause. NSAIDs , rest , heat , and time are the basis of treatment for inflammatory conditions. Steroid injections into readily accessible bursae may be useful if infection has been excluded. Avoid injecting tendons with steroids. Treat infections with antibiotics (see Chapter 180, 'Acute Disorders of the Joints and Bursae,' for specific  recommendations).  Admit  immunocompromised  patients  with suspected infections for IV antibiotics and orthopedic surgery consultation (Table 179-2).

# ■ MYOFASCIAL SYNDROMES/OVERUSE SYNDROMES

Repetitive microtrauma that outpaces the body's ability to heal results in overuse  syndromes.  Treatment  generally  consists  of NSAIDs , heat ,  and rest ,  followed  by  gradual  resumption  of  activities,  physical  therapy,  and strengthening where appropriate (Table 179-2).

# ■ BONE/ARTICULAR DERANGEMENTS

Osteonecrosis (also called aseptic necrosis, ischemic necrosis, or avascular necrosis) is bone infarction caused by a lack of blood supply. It may be an idiopathic or a primary disorder, secondary to a systemic condition, or due to  trauma.  Conditions  associated  with  osteonecrosis  of  the  femoral  head include  femoral  neck  fracture,  hip  dislocation,  occult  or  minor  trauma, sickle cell disease, collagen vascular diseases, alcohol abuse, renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus, dysbarism, chronic pancreatitis, exogenous  steroid  administration,  Cushing  disease,  decompression  sickness, Gaucher disease, and renal osteodystrophy. Osteonecrosis of the hip may cause pain anywhere from the buttock to the knee. X-ray, CT, or MRI may aid in diagnosis. Joint replacement may be needed.

Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone that results in bony destruction commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus . Patients have local pain and may  have  associated  warmth,  swelling,  and  erythema.  Imaging  may  be normal. MRI is the preferred imaging study but bone biopsy is required for confirmation.  The  acutely  ill  patient  should  receive high-dose,  broadspectrum, parenteral antibiotics based on the patient's risk factors and most likely organisms (Table 179-3).

Osteitis pubis occurs following pregnancy, in athletes due to overuse of the adductors and gracilis muscles, and after bladder and prostate surgery. It causes pain in the region of the pubis and generally resolves over a period of months with rest and NSAIDs . Myositis ossificans (also known as heterotopic  calcification)  is  the  deposition  of  bone  in  abnormal  sites  after direct trauma. Pain and a palpable mass will be present. Pain or physical obstruction may limit motion in the affected muscle or joint. Surgery may be required.

# Acute Disorders of The Joints and Bursae

Andrew D. Perron

Acute disorders of the joints and bursae are common emergency conditions that involve a wide spectrum of ages, acuities, and etiologies. Mismanagement of certain pathologic entities can lead to significant morbidity for the patient.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Multiple pathways can cause disruption of the normal joint milieu leading to acute joint complaints. These pathways include degeneration of articular cartilage with osteoarthritis, deposition of immune complexes as in rheumatoid  arthritis,  crystal-induced  inflammation  in  gout  and  pseudogout, seronegative  spondyloarthropathies  such  as  ankylosing  spondylitis  and Reiter's  syndrome,  and  the  bacterial  or  viral  invasion  of  septic  arthritis. These pathologic events invariably lead to pain, the most common complaint of patients with a joint problem. Important historical factors to elicit include  a  determination  of  previous  joint  or  bursal  disease,  presence  of constitutional symptoms and whether the pain is acute, chronic, or acute on chronic.  Determining  the  number  and  distribution  of  joints  affected  can help narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 180-1). A migratory pattern of

joint  pain  can  be  seen  with  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  and  in  many infectious  etiologies  such  as  gonococcal  arthritis,  acute  rheumatic  fever, Lyme disease, and viral arthritis.

On  physical  examination,  arthritis  should  be  distinguished  from more  focal  periarticular  inflammatory  processes  such  as  cellulitis, bursitis,  and  tendonitis. True  arthritis  produces  joint  pain  exacerbated by active and passive motions. Skin erythema and warmth overlying a joint should be noted, although it is nonspecific regarding etiology of joint pathology.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

With the exception of recent joint surgery or cellulitis overlying a prosthetic knee or hip, history, physical examination, and routine blood tests do not distinguish  acute  septic  arthritis  from  other  forms  of  arthritis.  Clinicians who suspect septic arthritis based on the patient's presentation should perform arthrocentesis. Synovial fluid should be sent for culture, Gram stain, cell count, and crystal evaluation (Table 180-2). Except in pediatric septic arthritis, where the erythrocyte sedimentation rate has been shown to have 90% sensitivity, the serum white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate lack the sensitivity and specificity to be reliable discriminators in disorders of the joints and bursae. Adults with risk factors for sexually transmitted  disease  and  migratory  symptoms  or  tenosynovitis  should  be evaluated for gonococcal arthritis.

Radiographs  should  be  obtained  when  the  differential  diagnosis includes trauma, tumor, osteomyelitis, ankylosing spondylitis, or avascular  necrosis.  More sophisticated modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and radioisotope scanning are used in isolated cases.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE AND DISPOSITION

Septic  arthritis is  a  condition  that  can  rapidly  lead  to  irreversible  joint destruction if inadequately treated. It typically presents as a monoarticular arthritis  and  may  be  associated  with  fever,  chills,  or  malaise,  although absence of these symptoms does not exclude the diagnosis. The synovial fluid may help confirm the diagnosis, although there is significant overlap in fluid findings between a number of pathological entities that can affect a joint.  Therapy  requires  admission  for  parenteral  antibiotics  and  repeated needle aspiration, arthroscopy, or open surgical drainage. Specific patient demographics can help guide empiric antibiotic therapy in septic arthritis (Table 180-3). For most of these conditions, arthrocentesis will guide diagnosis,  therapy,  and  disposition.  As  a  general  rule,  skin  overlying  the intended joint should be free of cellulitis. Skin is cleansed with povidoneiodine which should be allowed to air-dry. The intended site should then be cleaned with an alcohol wipe. Skin can be anesthetized with either lidocaine or with ethyl chloride spray. In general, a large-bore needle, 18-G or 19-G, should be used for larger joints such as shoulders and knees while it may be necessary to use a smaller needle for digits.

Traumatic  hemarthrosis is  associated  with  intraarticular  fracture  or ligamentous injury. Aspiration of large effusions may decrease pain and increase range of motion. Treatment is supportive. Spontaneous hemarthrosis may be associated with coagulopathies requiring specific clotting factor replacement. It is usually not recommended to aspirate spontaneous hemarthroses.

SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

Crystal-induced  synovitis generally  affects  middle-age  to  elderly patients. Gout involves deposition of uric acid crystals, typically affecting the great toe, tarsal joints, and knee, whereas pseudogout involves deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals, typically affecting the knee, wrist, ankle, and elbow. Pain with gout usually evolves over hours, whereas the pain associated with pseudogout occurs over a day or more. Either condition may be precipitated by trauma, surgery, significant illness, dietary or alcohol indiscretions, or certain medications. The synovial fluid is inflammatory  with  negative  birefringent  needle-shaped  crystals  in  gout,  and weakly positive birefringent rhomboid crystals in pseudogout. Treatment is with  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  such  as ibuprophen 400  to 800 mg three times daily for 3 to 5 days and opioid analgesics. Although not  routinely  necessary, colchicine 0.6  mg/h  orally  until  resolution  of symptoms  or  intolerable  gastrointestinal  side  effects  may  be  used  as  a complementary therapy.

Osteoarthritis is  a  chronic,  symmetric,  polyarticular  destruction  of joints  distinguished  by  a  lack  of  constitutional  symptoms.  Patients  may present with acute monoarticular exacerbations with small, noninflammatory synovial fluid collections and characteristic joint space narrowing on radiographs. Treatment involves rest and analgesics.

Lyme arthritis is  a  monoarticular or symmetric oligoarticular arthritis, especially of the large joints, with brief exacerbations followed by complete remission occurring weeks to years after the primary infection. Synovial fluid  is  inflammatory,  typically  with  negative  cultures.  Treatment  with appropriate antibiotics such as doxycycline , erythromycin , or amoxicillin for 3 to 4 weeks is effective.

Gonococcal  arthritis is  an  immune-mediated  infectious  arthritis  that typically affects adolescents and young adults. Fever, chills, and a migratory tenosynovitis or arthralgias typically precede mono- or oligoarthritis. Vesiculopustular lesions on the distal extremities are characteristic. Synovial fluid is usually inflammatory and often culture negative; cultures of the pharynx, urethra, cervix, and rectum increase the culture yield. The patient should  be  admitted  for  pain  control  and  parenteral  antibiotic  therapy. Orthopedic consultation is advised.

Reiter's  syndrome is  a  seronegative  reactive  spondyloarthropathy characterized by acute asymmetric oligoarthritis, especially of the lower extremities, preceded 2 to 6 weeks prior by an infectious illness such as urethritis  caused  by Ureaplasma or Chlamydia ,  or  enteric  infection caused by Salmonella or Shigella . The classic triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis,  and  urethritis  is  not  required  for  the  diagnosis.  Synovial fluid is inflammatory. Treatment is symptomatic, and antibiotics have not been found to be useful.

Ankylosing  spondylitis is  a  seronegative  spondyloarthropathy  that primarily affects the spine and pelvis and may be associated with morning stiffness and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. Hereditary predilection, with HLA-B27 antigen or absence of rheumatoid factor, is significant. Radiographic findings include sacroiliitis and squaring of the vertebral bodies, known as bamboo spine. Treatment is symptomatic.

Rheumatoid arthritis is  a  chronic,  symmetric,  polyarticular  joint  disease, with sparing of the distal interphalangeal joints and associated with

--- Page 1007 ---

CHAPTER 180: Acute Disorders of The Joints and Bursae

987

morning stiffness, depression, fatigue, and generalized myalgias. Pericarditis, myocarditis, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and mononeuritis multiplex  may  occur.  Synovial  fluid  is  inflammatory.  Treatment  of  an  acute exacerbation  involves  immobilization,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs, and, occasionally, corticosteroids. Antimalarials, immunosuppressants,  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drugs,  and  cytotoxic  agents  are used for long-term therapy.

Bursitis refers  to  an  inflammatory  process  involving  any  of  the  more than 150 bursae throughout the human body and may be caused by infection, trauma, rheumatologic diseases, or crystal deposition. Certain repetitive activities may also precipitate bursitis: prepatellar bursitis, known as 'carpet layer's knee' or olecranon bursitis, known as 'student's elbow.' A suspicion for septic bursitis, especially in olecranon bursitis, necessitates aspiration of bursal fluid. Septic bursal fluid characteristically is purulent in appearance,  with  more  than  1500  leukocytes/mm 3   and  positive  culture. Treatment principles include drainage, rest, compressive dressing, analgesics,  and antibiotics for septic bursitis. Septic bursitis generally responds well  to  oral  antibiotics,  with  emphasis  on  coverage  of Staphylococcus , including  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus and Streptococcus species.

Patients who present to the ED with systemic rheumatic disease manifestations  are  often  at  risk  for  pain  and  discomfort,  organ  damage,  infection, adverse  drug  events,  and  significant  morbidity  or  mortality,  especially  if their disease presentation is not properly recognized and managed.

# ■ CLINICaL FeatUreS

# airway Emergencies

Cricoarytenoid joint arthritis, seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), and relapsing polychondritis (RP), can present with throat pain, a fullness in the throat, voice changes, and tenderness over cartilaginous  structures.  More  severe  cases  lead  to  dyspnea  and  stridor, leading to acute upper airway obstruction. Evaluate using CT imaging or fiber  optic  laryngoscopy;  initial  treatment  consists  of  high-dose  steroids, such as methylprednisolone 250 mg IV.

Endotracheal  intubation  is  often  difficult  in  patients  with  systemic rheumatic disease; thus, consider 'dual setup' preparation for cricothyrotomy.  Moreover,  neck  hyperextension  should  be  avoided  in  patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis due to the risk  of  cervical  fractures,  subluxation  and  dislocation,  and  spinal  cord compression.

# Pulmonary Emergencies

Systemic sclerosis, RA, SLE, Wegener's granulomatosis, and polymyositis can cause chronic pulmonary symptoms through processes such as

--- Page 1013 ---

CHAPTER 181: Emergencies in Systemic Rheumatic Diseases

993

interstitial lung disease or acute complications such as alveolar hemorrhage. The risk of pneumonia is elevated due to disease processes and immunosuppression. Pleural effusions are seen in RA and SLE. Systemic rheumatic diseases place patients at higher risk of pulmonary embolism.

Distinguishing pneumonia from alveolar hemorrhage can be difficult, as fever and x-ray infiltrates are common in both conditions. Anemia is often sensitive for alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoscopy can confirm the diagnosis,  but  treatment  in  the  ED  is  high-dose  glucocorticoids  in patients  with  alveolar  hemorrhage  versus  antibiotics  for  patients  with pneumonia.

# Cardiovascular Emergencies

Systemic  rheumatic  disease  can  injure  the  heart  through  several  mechanisms. Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is seen in SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome, and RA, and are considered risk factors for coronary artery disease.

Pericarditis can occur in RA and SLE, and pancarditis is a feature of acute rheumatic fever.

Aortitis and aortic aneurysms can be seen in patients with a history of  giant  cell  (temporal)  arteritis,  Takayasu's  arteritis,  and  Behçet's disease, leading to rupture, dissection, neurologic symptoms, or coronary syndromes.

# Neurologic and Ophthalmologic Emergencies

Vascular inflammation and accelerated vascular disease, as well as direct involvement from systemic rheumatologic disease, can lead to neurologic and ophthalmologic emergencies. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke symptoms  are  usually  not  subtle,  but  vertebrobasilar  circulation  lesions  may present as vertigo, hearing loss, or ataxia.

Sudden  blindness  is  associated  with  giant  cell  (temporal)  arteritis; patients may also present with signs of jaw and tongue claudication. Temporal artery biopsy can confirm the diagnosis; however, high-dose steroids should be administered empirically.

Excessive tearing, redness, vision changes, and pain can be manifestations of systemic rheumatic disease.

# Renal Emergencies

Almost all systemic rheumatic disease can involve the kidney. SLE, Wegener's  granulomatosis,  and  systemic  vasculitis  can  lead  to  nephritis.  Distal renal  tubular  acidosis,  with  associated  hypokalemia,  occurs  in  30%  of patients with Sjogrën's syndrome and presents as a progressive weakness. Other rheumatic processes can progress to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.

# Gastrointestinal Emergencies

GI manifestations of systemic rheumatic disease are the most commonly vasculitides, from giant-cell arteritis affecting larger vessels to SLE affecting small vessels. These processes present with abdominal pain, ileus, or obstruction, and can lead to bowel ischemia.

--- Page 1014 ---

994 SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

# ■ Other OrGaN SYSteMS

Anemia,  leukopenia,  and  thrombocytopenia  are  commonly  observed  in systemic  rheumatic  disease.  Antiphospholipid  disease  can  present  with thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpora.  Hemolytic  anemia  is  observed  in SLE and systemic sclerosis.

Malignant hypertension can be seen with systemic sclerosis, antiphospholipid  syndrome,  and  polyarteritis  nodosa.  Hypertension  is  also  a complication of rheumatic processes (and medications) that involve the kidney.

Dermatologic manifestations of rheumatic disease include rash, ulcers, and cellulitis, as well as Raynaud's phenomenon.

Orchitis  is  commonly  seen  in  polyarteritis  nodosa  and  HenochSchonlein purpura. Ultrasound should be performed as the presentation mimics testicular torsion.

# Infectious Emergencies/Immunosuppression

Systemic rheumatic diseases themselves cause direct immunosuppression, as do many of the medications to treat them. Anatomic changes resulting from disease  progression  can  also  predispose  to  infection.  Opportunistic species as well as typical causative agents are seen.

Empiric antibiotics are indicated for patients with apparent infections; procalcitonin levels greater than 0.5 ng/mL are specific for sepsis in autoimmune disease.

Septic arthritis is more common in patients with RA on steroids or biologic agents, and often presents with a less impressive exam than patients not taking these medications. The clinician should have a low threshold for arthrocentesis.

# adverse Drug Reactions

Stressors  or  abrupt  withdrawal  from  steroids  can  trigger  adrenal  insufficiency. Patients will present with hypotension; hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia are commonly seen. Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV is the emergent treatment.

Hypertension  and  renal  insufficiency  are  seen  in  many  patients taking  biologic  agents  to  treat  rheumatic  disease,  as  well  as  NSAIDs and cyclophosphamide.

Some  biologic  agents  are  associated  with  increased  risk  of  zoster lesions, particularly zoster ophthalmicus.

Drainage of pus, immobilization, elevation, and antibiotics are the mainstays of treatment for many conditions of the hand. This helps to decrease inflammation, avoid secondary injury, and prevent extension of any infection. Optimal splinting is in the position of function: wrist in 15° to 30° extension, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints in 50° to 90° flexion, and the interphalangeal joints in 10° to 15° flexion.

# ■ HAND INFECTIONS

Cellulitis is a superficial infection presenting with localized warmth, erythema, and edema. Absence of tenderness on deep palpation and nonpainful digit range of motion help to exclude deep space involvement.

Flexor tenosynovitis is a surgical emergency diagnosed on examination (Table 182-1).

Deep space infections involve the thenar, web, or midpalmar space, or the radial or ulnar bursa. Infection occurs from spread of a flexor tenosynovitis or a penetrating wound. The palm is tender to palpation and range of motion of the digits is painful where the flexor tendons course through the area of infection. Swelling from web space infection causes separation of the affected digits. Deep space infections often require operative drainage.

Closed  fist  injury is  essentially  a  bite  wound  to  the  MCP  joint  that results from a punch to the teeth. There is high risk of infection to the skin, tendon, joint, bone, and deep space. Wounds penetrating the skin require exploration, irrigation, prophylactic antibiotics, and healing by secondary intention. Wounds with established signs of infection require IV antibiotics and hand surgery consult for consideration of operative intervention.

Paronychia is an infection of the lateral nail fold. If there is no pus, treat  with  warm  soaks,  elevation,  and  antibiotics  if  warranted. A  paronychia is drained by lifting the nail fold with a flat blade. If pus is seen beneath  the  nail,  a  portion  of  the  nail  may  need  removal  and  packing placed for adequate drainage. Recheck within 48 hours, pull the packing, and begin warm soaks.

Felon is  an  infection  of  the  pulp  space  of  the  fingertip.  Incision  and drainage are by the lateral approach to protect the neurovascular bundle. Do not  incise  the  distal  end  of  the  finger  pad.  Do  not  extend  the  incision proximally  to  the  flexor  crease  of  the  distal  interphalangeal  joint.  More extensive through-and-through or 'hockey stick' incisions are not indicated.

Bluntly dissect the septae to ensure complete drainage. If there is a pointing volar abscess, a longitudinal volar incision is used. Pack the wound. Splint the  finger.  Recheck  within  48  hours,  pull  the  packing,  and  begin  warm soaks.

Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection of the distal finger. It may present similar to a felon, but vesicles are present. Immobilize, elevate, and protect with a dry dressing to prevent transmission. Antiviral agents may shorten the duration.

# ■ NONINFECTIOUS CONDITIONS

Tendonitis and tenosynovitis are usually due to overuse. Examination reveals tenderness over the tendon and pain with activation or passive stretch. Treat with immobilization and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Trigger finger is a tenosynovitis of the flexor sheath. Inflammation or scarring results in impingement and snap release of the tendon as the finger is  extended  from  a  flexed  position.  Steroid  injection  may  be  effective. Definitive treatment is surgery.

DeQuervain  tenosynovitis involves  the  extensor  pollicis  brevis  and abductor pollicis tendons. Pain occurs at the radial aspect of the wrist and radiates  into  the  forearm.  The  Finkelstein  test  is  diagnostic:  the  patient grasps the thumb in the fist and deviates the hand ulnarly, reproducing the pain. Treat with a thumb spica splint, NSAIDs, and referral.

Carpal tunnel syndrome results from compression of the median nerve by the transverse carpal ligament. The cause is usually edema from overuse, pregnancy, or congestive heart failure. Pain in the median nerve distribution tends to be worse at night. The pain may be reproduced by tapping over the nerve at the wrist (Tinel's sign) or by holding the wrist flexed maximally for > 1 minute (Phalen's test). Treat with a wrist splint, NSAIDs, and referral.

Dupuytren contracture results from fibrous changes in the subcutaneous tissues of the palm which may lead to tethering and joint contractures. Refer to a hand surgeon.

Ganglion cyst is a collection of fluid from synovial tissue that herniates from a joint capsule or tendon sheath. Treat with NSAIDs and referral.

# Soft Tissue Problems of The Foot

Gavin R. Budhram

# ■ CORNS AND CALLUSES

Calluses represent a dermatologic reaction to focal pressure. They are protective and should not be treated unless they are painful. Ongoing pressure may cause calluses to develop into corns. Corns have a central hyperkaratotic core that is often painful. Hard corns can resemble warts, but can be differentiated with incision; warts will bleed, corns will not. The differential  diagnosis  includes  syphilis,  psoriasis,  lichen  planus,  rosacea,  arsenic poisoning, basal cell nevus syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment for corns often includes paring with a scalpel to include removal of central keratin plug, but topical salicylic acid treatments may be more effective.

# ■ PLANTAR WARTS

Plantar warts are common, contagious, and caused by the human papillomavirus. The diagnosis is clinical and the differential includes corns and undiagnosed melanoma. Topical treatment with 15% to 20% salicylic acid is most effective. Nonhealing lesions should be referred to a dermatologist or podiatrist.

# ■ ONYCHOCRYPTOSIS (INGROWN TOENAIL)

Onychocryptosis is characterized by increased inflammation or infection of the lateral or medial aspects of the toenail. This occurs when the nail plate penetrates the nail sulcus and subcutaneous tissue (usually in the great toe). Patients  with  underlying  diabetes,  arterial  insufficiency,  cellulitis,  ulceration, or necrosis are at risk for amputation if treatment is delayed. Treatment  depends  on  the  type  of  inflammation.  If  the  toenail  is  uninfected, sufficient  results  will  often  be  obtained  with  elevation  of  the  nail  with  a wisp of cotton between the nail plate and the skin, daily foot soaks, and avoidance of pressure on the area. A second option (requiring digital block) is to remove a spicule of the nail and debride the nail groove (Fig. 183-1). If  granulation tissue or infection is present, partial removal of the nail is indicated. If the toenail is infected, perform digital block and cut one-fourth or less of the nail, including beneath the cuticle, with a longitudinal incision (Fig. 183-2). A nonadherent bulky dressing should be placed and the wound should be checked in 24 to 48 hours.

# ■ BURSITIS

Calcaneal  bursitis  causes  pain  over  the  posterior  heel  in  contrast  to Achilles tendinopathy that causes pain and tenderness 2 to 6 cm superior to the posterior calcaneus. Pathologic bursae of the foot are categorized as follows: (1) noninflammatory, (2) inflammatory, (3) suppurative, and (4)  calcified.  Noninflammatory  bursae  become  painful  as  a  result  of

998

--- Page 1019 ---

CHAPTER 183: Soft Tissue Problems of The Foot

999

direct pressure and resolve with simple measures including comfortable footwear, rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Inflammatory bursitis results from gout, syphilis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Suppurative  bursitis  results  from  spread  of  pyogenic  organisms  (often Staphylococcus  aureus )  from  adjacent  wounds.  Complications  include hygroma,  calcified  bursae,  fistula,  and  ulcer  formation.  Treatment  for septic bursitis is discussed in Chapter 180, "Acute Disorders of the Joints and Bursae."

# ■ PLANTAR FASCIITIS

The  plantar  fascia  is  connective  tissue  anchoring  the  plantar  skin  to  the bone. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain due to overuse. Patients have pain on the plantar surface of the foot that is worse when initiating walking and point tenderness over the anterior-medial calcaneus

--- Page 1020 ---

1000 SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

that is worsened by dorsiflexion of the toes. The presence of heel spurs on radiography is of no diagnostic value because many patients without plantar  fasciitis  have  this  finding.  Treatment  includes  rest,  ice,  and  NSAIDs. Most  of  the  cases  are  self-limited  and  resolve  spontaneously  within 12 months. Plantar stretch exercises, including using the hands to dorsiflex the ankle and toes are helpful in the acute phase. Glucocorticoid injections are not indicated in the ED. Patients with severe cases may require a shortleg walking cast and should be referred to a podiatrist or orthopedist.

# ■ NERVE ENTRAPMENT SYNDROMES

# Tarsal Tunnel Syndromes

Tarsal tunnel syndrome involves heel and foot pain due to compression of the  posterior  tibial  nerve  as  it  courses  inferior  to  the  medial  malleolus. Causes  include  running,  restrictive  footwear,  edema  of  pregnancy,  posttraumatic  fibrosis,  ganglion  cysts,  osteophytes,  and  tumors.  Symptoms include numbness or burning of the sole and may be limited to the heel. Pain is worse at night and after running or standing, in contrast to plantar fasciitis which is worse upon morning standing. Typically, pain is located at the medial malleolus, the heel, the sole, and the distal calf.

The differential diagnosis includes plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis. Percussion inferior to the medial malleolus yields pain radiating to  the  medial  or  lateral  plantar  surface  (Tinel  sign),  and  eversion  and dorsiflexion  worsen  symptoms.  Treatment  includes  NSAIDs,  rest,  and possible orthopedic referral.

# Deep Peroneal Nerve entrapment

Entrapment  of  the  deep  peroneal  nerve  occurs  most  frequently  where  it courses beneath the extensor retinaculum at the anterior aspect of the ankle. Recurrent ankle sprains, soft tissue masses, and restrictive footwear represent the most common causes. Symptoms include dorsal and medial foot pain  as  well  as  sensory  hypoesthesia  at  the  first  web  space.  Prolonged entrapment may cause loss of the ability to hyperextend the toes.

Pain and tenderness can be elicited by plantar flexion during inversion of the foot. Treatment includes NSAIDs, rest, and possible orthopedic referral.

# ■ GANGLIONS

A ganglion is a benign synovial cyst attached to a joint capsule or tendon sheath  near  the  anterolateral  ankle.  Typically  a  firm,  nontender,  cystic lesion is found on examination. The diagnosis is clinical, but MRI or ultrasound can be used if in doubt. Treatment includes aspiration and injection of glucocorticoids, but most require surgical excision.

# ■ TENDON LESIONS

# Tenosynovitis and Tendinitis

Tenosynovitis and tendonitis are usually due to overuse and present with pain over the involved tendon. The flexor hallucis longus, posterior tibialis, and Achilles tendon are most commonly involved. Treatment includes ice, rest, and NSAIDs.

CHAPTER 183: Soft Tissue Problems of The Foot 1001

# Tendon Lacerations

Tendon lacerations in the foot are complex, and orthopedic consultation is needed. After repair, extensor tendons are immobilized in dorsiflexion and flexor tendons in equinus.

# Tendon ruptures

Spontaneous rupture of the Achilles tendon is common, but rupture of the other tendons of the foot can occur. Age and chronic corticosteroid and fluoroquinolone  use  are  risk  factors  for  spontaneous  rupture. Achilles tendon rupture presents with pain and a palpable defect in the area of the tendon. Patients have an inability to stand on tiptoes and an absence of plantar flexion with squeezing of the calf (Thompson test). Treatment is generally surgical in younger patients and conservative (casting in equinus) in the elderly. Anterior tibialis tendon rupture results in a palpable defect and mild foot drop. In most cases surgery is not necessary. Posterior  tibialis  tendon rupture  is  usually  chronic  and  presents  with  a  flattened arch and swelling over the medial ankle. Examination may show weakness on inversion, a palpable defect, and inability to stand on tiptoes. Flexor hallucis longus rupture presents with loss of plantar flexion of the great toe. The need for surgical repair depends on the patient's occupation and lifestyle. Disruption of the peroneal retinaculum occurs after a direct blow  during  dorsiflexion  and  causes  localized  pain  behind  the  lateral malleolus;  there  is  clicking  during  walking,  as  the  tendon  is  subluxed. Treatment is surgical.

# ■ PLANTAR INTERDIGITAL NEUROMA (MORTON NEUROMA)

Neuromas  are  thought  to  occur  from  entrapment  of  the  plantar  digital nerve proximal to its bifurcation due to tight-fitting shoes; the third interspace  is  most  commonly  affected.  Patients  often  present  with  burning, cramping, or aching over the affected metatarsal head, and numbness in the toe. Pain is easily reproduced upon palpation of the area and at times a mass is felt. Diagnosis is clinical, but ultrasound or MRI may be helpful. Conservative treatment includes wide shoes and glucocorticoid injections. Local glucocorticoid injections may be curative. Surgical neurolysis is occasionally required.

# ■ COMPARTMENT SYNDROMES OF THE FOOT

The foot has nine compartments. Compartment syndromes in the foot are associated with high-energy crush injuries. Other causes include bleeding disorders  and  postischemic  swelling  after  arterial  injury,  foot  and  ankle fractures (especially calcaneal and Lisfranc's fracture/dislocation), burns, and chronic overuse. Pain out of proportion to injury is one of the early findings. Additional symptoms include pain that is worsened on active and passive movement, paresthesias, and neurovascular deficits. Absent pulse and complete anesthesia are late findings.

At-risk patients must have compartment pressures checked. Any difference of less than 30 mm Hg between the Stryker STIC Device (Stryker,

--- Page 1022 ---

1002 SECTION 20: Nontraumatic Musculoskeletal Disorders

Kalamazoo,  MI)  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  is  considered  positive. Prompt consideration of emergent fasciotomy is indicated.

# ■ MALIGNANT MELANOMA

Melanoma of the foot, which accounts for 15% of all cutaneous melanomas, may present as atypical nonpigmented or pigmented lesions; the nail may be included. Vigilance is key as these lesions often mimic more benign conditions.  The  differential  diagnosis  includes  fungal  infections,  plantar warts, and foot ulcers. Because prognosis is directly related to early diagnosis, all atypical or nonhealing lesions should be referred for biopsy.

SECTION

# Psychosocial Disorders

21

# ■ INCIDENCE

Mental illness affects 26.2% of the population of the world's adult population in any given year.

# ■ DEMENTIA

Dementia is a disorder consisting of a pervasive disturbance in cognition that impairs memory, abstraction, judgment, personality, and higher critical  functions  such  as  language.  Its  onset  is  typically  gradual,  and  the patient's  normal  level  of  consciousness  is  maintained.  The  presence  of global cognitive impairment can be detected by using a bedside screening test  such  as  the  Mini-Mental  State  Exam  or  the  Clock  Drawing  Test. Potentially  reversible  causes  of  dementia  should  be  sought  including metabolic and endocrine disorders, adverse drug effects and interactions, and depression.

# Delirium

Delirium is characterized by acute development of impairment in cognitive function,  diminished  level  of  consciousness,  inattention,  and  sensory misperceptions that fluctuate over the course of hours. Visual hallucinations are  common. Delirium is  frequently  missed  in  the  ED  and  is  associated with a high mortality rate. The causes of delirium should be sought and treated.  Causes  include  infection,  electrolyte  abnormalities,  toxic  and medication ingestion, and head injury

# Amnestic Disorders

Amnestic  patients  cannot  learn  new  information  or  recall  previously learned information. Amnesia may be due to brain trauma, stroke, anoxic brain injury, substance abuse, and chronic nutritional deficiencies.

1003

--- Page 1024 ---

1004 SECTION 21: Psychosocial Disorders

# Substance-Use Disorders

Intoxication  is  an  exogenous  substance-induced  syndrome  that  results  in maladaptive behavior and impaired cognitive functioning and psychomotor activity.  Judgment,  perception,  attention,  and  emotional  control  may  be affected. Substance withdrawal symptoms may develop when the amount ingested is reduced or stopped. The symptoms and timing of withdrawal depend on the substance of abuse.

# Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

Schizophrenia is a chronic disease characterized by positive symptoms such  as  hallucinations,  delusions,  disorganized  speech  or  behavior,  or catatonic behavior and negative symptoms such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, lack of spontaneity, anhedonia, or impaired attention. Chronic  illness  is  distinguished  by  cognitive  impairment  with  loose associations or incoherence and the relative absence of a mood disorder. Patients may present to the emergency department for worsening psychosis, suicidal ideations, crisis, bizarre or violent behavior, or adverse medication events. Typical antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, effectively treat the positive symptoms, and newer atypical antipsychotic medications,  such  as aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone,  ziprasidone,  and  clozapine,  effectively  treat  positive  and negative symptoms. The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made when an individual experiences symptoms and demonstrates signs consistent  with  schizophrenia  for  less  than  6  months.  A  brief  psychotic disorder  is  a  psychosis  that  lasts  less  than  4  weeks  in  response  to  a traumatic life experience, such as sexual assault, natural disaster, combat, or death of a loved one. Schizophrenia is treated with antipsychotic medications.

# Mood Disorders

# Major Depression

Major depression is characterized by a persistent dysphoric mood or a pervasive  loss  of  interest  and  pleasure  in  usual  activities  (anhedonia) that  lasts  longer  than  2  weeks.  Associated  psychological  symptoms include feelings of guilt over past events, self-reproach, worthlessness, hopelessness,  and  recurrent  thoughts  of  death  or  suicide.  Physiologic symptoms  include  loss  of  appetite  and  weight,  sleep  disturbances, fatigue, inability to concentrate, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. The diagnosis should be entertained in any patient presenting with multiple vague complaints. The lifetime risk of suicide in patients with this disorder is 15%. All patients suspected of having major depression should  be  questioned  about  suicidal  thoughts.  Depression  is  typically treated with SSRIs.

# Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is characterized by recurrent, cyclic episodes of manic and depressive symptoms, with depressive episodes being more common

--- Page 1025 ---

CHAPTER 184: Clinical Features of Behavioral Disorders

1005

than manic episodes. Manic individuals experience an elated mood that can quickly deteriorate to irritability and hostility. They appear energetic and  expansive,  with  a  decreased  need  for  sleep,  poor  impulse  control, racing  thoughts,  auditory  hallucinations,  grandiose  ideas  and  pressured speech. Complications may include suicide, substance abuse, and marital and occupational disruptions. Bipolar illness is treated with lithium and valproate.

# Anxiety Disorders

Panic disorder consists of recurrent episodes of severe anxiety and sudden, extreme autonomic symptoms. It is a diagnosis of exclusion as these symptoms can also occur in life-threatening cardiovascular and pulmonary  disorders.  The  diagnosis  of  generalized  anxiety  disorder  can  be made  when  a  patient  experiences  persistent  worry  or  tension  without discrete panic attacks for at least 6 months. Phobias consist of symptoms of anxiety, recognized as excessive by the person, prompted by the exposure to, or the anticipated exposure to, a specific stimulus. Posttraumatic stress disorder is an anxiety reaction to a severe, psychosocial stressor, typically perceived as life threatening. The individual experiences repetitive,  intrusive memories of the event. Nightmares, feelings of guilt and depression, and substance abuse are common. Individuals with obsessivecompulsive disorder experience intrusive thoughts or images that create anxiety (obsessions). To control these thoughts and anxiety, the individual engages in repetitive behaviors or rituals (compulsions). Anxiety disorders may be treated with benzodiazepines.

# ■ pErSONALITY DISOrDErS

Individuals  with  a  personality  disorder  exhibit  a  lifelong  pattern  of  maladaptive behavior that is not limited to periods of illness. Personality disorders include paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic,  narcissistic,  avoidant,  dependent,  and  obsessive-compulsive. Personality disorders are difficult to treat.

Leslie S. Zun

# ■ INCIDENCE

In the last two decades, mental health-related visits to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States increased by 38% to 23.6 per 1000 population.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Psychiatric patients present to EDs with various complaints including agitation,  depression,  suicide  ideation,  mania,  or  other  abnormal  behaviors. Some patients have overt psychiatric presentations while some may present with  less  obvious  presentations  such  as  panic  disorders,  depression,  or suicidal ideation.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

The role of the emergency physician is to determine whether the psychiatric presentation is due to a medical or psychiatric etiology in order to decide on  an  appropriate  patient  disposition.  This  differentiation  is  made  more difficult  because  approximately  50%  of  these  patients  have  concomitant medical illnesses, most frequently hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and substance use disorder. Some psychiatric patients need treatment for agitation prior  to  evaluation  in  order  to  obtain  vital  signs,  pulse  oxygenation,  and glucose assessment. The evaluation process includes a detailed medical and psychiatric  history,  medication  history,  social  history,  and  a  physical examination, including a thorough neurologic and mental status evaluation. The 'red flags' for medical illness include initial presentation over the age of 45, abnormal vital signs, focal neurologic deficit, exposure to drugs or toxins, abnormal physical exam findings, and cognitive deficit. Some of the elements of the mental status examination are routinely assessed as part of the history and physical exam: appearance, behavior and attitude, and mood and affect. A number of items need to be specifically tested such as disorders of thought inquiring about suicidal and homicidal ideation, insight and judgment about their illness, disorders of perception such as hallucinations, and cognitive impairment using the Mini Mental State Exam or the clock drawing  test.  Factors  associated  with  high  risk  of  suicide  include  male gender, unmarried or recent loss of relationship, family history of suicide, substance abuse, history of depression or psychosis, hopelessness, frequent and pervasive thoughts of suicide, previous attempts, availability of a lethal method, and poor social support. Laboratory testing and imaging of psychiatric patients should be clinically driven rather than rote. Patients with new onset of psychiatric symptoms and patients with chronic mental illness and a new psychiatric presentation need such testing. The testing may include

complete blood count, serum electrolytes, liver function tests, urinalysis, urine drug screen, alcohol levels, and head CT scan. Elderly patients may need thyroid function testing, ECG, and CXR. Medical illnesses that may masquerade as psychiatric illness include hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, and delirium. Delirium has a high rate of mortality and is frequently missed in  the  ED.  It  has  a  fluctuating  course  with  change  in  consciousness  and alertness  as  well  as  confusion.  Tests  of  delirium  such  as  the  Confusion Assessment Method may be useful to identify these patients.

# ■ PANIC DISORDER

Panic disorder manifests with a wide variety of symptoms that mimic other major medical problems.

# Clinical Features

Panic disorder is defined as recurrent panic attacks followed by 1 month or more  of  persistent  worry  of  future  episodes  or  maladaptive  changes  in behavior related to the attack. Episodes begin unexpectedly; severity peaks within 10 minutes and symptoms last for up to 1 hour. Symptoms of panic attacks  include  palpitations,  sweating,  shortness  of  breath,  trembling  or shaking, choking sensation, chest pain or discomfort, nausea or abdominal distress, dizziness or light-headedness, paresthesias, chills or hot flashes, fear of losing control, fear of dying, and derealization or depersonalization.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Panic disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion because its symptoms and signs mimic those of many potentially life-threatening disorders. A thorough history and physical examination and, when indicated, other tests help rule out these life-threatening disorders. The differential diagnosis of panic attacks is listed in Table 186-1.

# emergency Department Care and Disposition

# ■ CONVERSION DISORDER

# Clinical Features

Patients with conversion disorder develop voluntary motor or sensory function deficits. The symptoms are not consciously produced by the patient and are usually in response to a stressor or conflict. The symptoms or deficits are not explained by a known organic etiology or culturally sanctioned response pattern. Organic disease may be concurrently present.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Other medical or mental illnesses must be excluded before the diagnosis of conversion disorder can be made. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes  stroke,  multiple  sclerosis,  polymyositis,  infectious  disorders,  as well as drug ingestions or poisonings. The examination techniques listed in Table 186-2 may help test for true neurologic deficits.

--- [TABLE DETECTED] ---
Table 186-2 | testing techniques for Conversion Disorder
Function | technique
Sensation | 
Yes/no test | Patient closes eyes and responds yes or no to touch stimulus. No response in numb area favors conversion disorder.
Bowlus and Currier test | Patient extends and then crosses the arms, with thumbs pointed down and palms facing together. Fingers (but not thumbs) are then interlocked, and then the hands are rotated inward toward chest. Sharp stimuli are applied to each finger in turn and the patient is asked to indicate normal or abnormal sensation in each digit. Patients with conversion disorder make mistakes and are inconsistent with responses.
Strength test | Patient closes eyes. Test 'strength' by touching finger to be moved. True lack of sensation would not allow patient to ascertain finger to be moved.

# Abuse and Assault

SECTION

22

# ■ CHILD ABUSE

Child maltreatment includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, parental substance abuse, and Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

# Clinical Features

Child  neglect  in  early  infancy  results  in  the  syndrome  of  failure  to  thrive. These children  are  frequently  brought  to  the  ED  because  of  other  medical problems, such as skin infections, severe diaper dermatitis, or acute gastroenteritis. Infants may have little subcutaneous tissue, protruding ribs, or occipital alopecia from lying on their back all day. They are wide eyed, wary, and difficult to console. They may have increased muscle tone in their lower extremities. Weight gain in the hospital is thought to be diagnostic of failure to thrive.

Children  over  the  age  of  2  with  environmental  neglect  are  termed psychosocial  dwarfs.  They  exhibit  short  stature,  bizarre  and  voracious appetites, and are hyperactive with unintelligible or delayed speech.

Physical  abuse  is  suggested  by  a  history  that  is  inconsistent  with  the nature of the injuries. The history of the event given by the caretaker may keep changing, or may be different from that given by the child.

The following findings suggest physical abuse: bruises over multiple areas, bites with an intercanine diameter > 3 cm, lacerations of the frenulum or oral mucosa from force-feeding, burns of an entire hand or foot, or burns of the buttocks or genitalia from toilet training punishment, cigarette burns, spiral fractures caused by twisting of long bones, metaphyseal chip fractures, periosteal elevation from new bone formation at sites of previous microfractures, multiple fractures at different stages of healing, fractures at unusual sites such as  lateral  clavicle,  ribs,  sternum,  vomiting,  irritability,  seizures,  change  in mental  status,  apnea,  or  retinal  hemorrhages  from  intracranial  hemorrhage (shaken  baby  syndrome).  V omiting,  abdominal  pain,  and  tenderness  with diminished bowel sounds or abdominal distention may be due to a duodenal hematoma, as evidenced by a 'double-bubble' sign on abdominal x-ray films.

Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a synonym for medical child abuse. A parent fabricates illness in a child in order to secure prolonged contact with health care providers. Complaints may be numerous and agents such as ipecac

1013

--- Page 1034 ---

1014 SECTION 22: Abuse and Assault

or  warfarin  may  have  been  given  to  precipitate  these  complaints.  Parents typically encourage more diagnostic tests, and are happy if they are positive.

Sexual abuse is suggested with complaints referable to the anogenital area, such as bleeding, discharge, or the presence of a sexually transmitted disease. Clefts or concavities in the hymen typically present in the 6 o'clock position.  Victims  of  child  abuse  may  be  overly  compliant  with  painful medical  procedures,  overly  protective  of  the  abusing  parent,  or  overly affectionate to medical staff.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Any serious injury in a child under the age of 5 should be viewed with suspicion. Parents and caregivers may appear to be under the influence of drugs  or  alcohol  and  refuse  diagnostic  studies.  Victims  of  neglect  may appear dirty, improperly clothed, and may be unimmunized.

A skeletal survey of the long bones will help detect evidence of physical abuse. See Chapter 157, 'Trauma in Children,' for further workup of traumatic injuries.

Inspect the genital area carefully for injury. Speculum examination in the preadolescent is not needed unless perforating vaginal trauma is suspected. Absence of physical findings does not rule out abuse.

Laboratory testing for sexual abuse should include cultures of the throat, vagina, and rectum for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Rapid antigen assays are not reliable forensic evidence in prepubescent children. Perform testing for syphilis if clinical concern exists. Test for HIV if clinically concerned and appropriate counseling is available. Syphilis, gonorrhea, and C trachomatis infections are considered presumptive evidence for sexual abuse, as is HIV, if not acquired perinatally or by transfusion.

Rarely, conditions such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, and osteogenesis imperfecta can mimic physical abuse.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Address all medical issues and injuries. Infants suspected of suffering from failure  to  thrive  and  children  with  suspected  Munchausen  syndrome  by proxy should be admitted to the hospital. Involve social services during the ED visit. Ensure a safe environment for each child. Every state requires reporting  of  suspected  cases  of  child  abuse. The  law  protects  physicians from legal retaliation from parents.

# ■ ELDErLY ABUSE

Elderly abuse is an act or omission resulting in harm to the health or welfare of an elderly person.

# Clinical Features

Physical  abuse  is  the  most  easily  recognized  form  of  elderly  abuse, although  chemical  restraint  such  as  intentional  overmedication  may  be subtle. Caregiver neglect , defined as failure of a caregiver to provide basic care, goods and services such as food, clothing, hygiene, medical care, and shelter, accounts for the majority of cases of elder abuse. Financial abuse is the second commonest form of abuse, and occurs when family members take control of or steal assets, checks, or pensions for personal gain.

--- Page 1035 ---

CHAPTER 187: Child and Elderly Abuse

1015

Emotional  abuse  entails  inflicting  anguish,  emotional  pain,  or  distress. Verbal threats, social isolation, and harassment can contribute to depression and other mental health problems. Self-neglect includes those behaviors of an elderly person that threaten his or her own safety: failure to provide adequate food,  medical  care,  hygiene,  clothing,  or  shelter.  The  spectrum  of  sexual abuse ranges from unwanted touching or indecent exposure to rape itself.

Caretakers  may  give  a  conflicting  report  of  an  injury  or  illness.  The patient may be fearful of his or her companion. The caretaker may seem indifferent or angry toward the patient, or may be overly concerned with costs of treatment needed by the patient.

# Diagnosis and Differential

Risk factors for elder abuse may be associated with caregivers, perpetrators, or with the elders. Patient characteristics include (a) cognitive impairment, (b) female sex, (c) physical dependency, (d) alcohol abuse, (e) developmental  disability,  (f)  special  medical  or  psychiatric  needs,  (g)  lack  of  social support, and (h) limited experience managing finances.

Risk factors for or characteristics of perpetrators of abuse include (a) history of violence within or outside of the family, (b) excessive dependence on the elder for financial support, (c) history of mental illness or substance abuse.

Patients should be interviewed in private. Screening questions for elder abuse are available. Areas of concern include whether anyone has touched or hurt them, forced them to do things, taken something of theirs without asking, threatened them, or made them feel afraid.

The following findings on physical examination are suggestive of abuse: bruising or trauma, poor general appearance and inappropriate hygiene or soiled clothing, malnutrition and dehydration, contusions and lacerations to normally protected areas of the body-inner thighs, mastoid, palms, soles, buttocks,  unusual  burns  or  multiple  burns  in  different  stages  of  healing, rope or restraint marks on ankles or wrists, spiral fractures of long bones, midshaft ulnar (nightstick) fractures from attempts to shield blows, multiple deep/uncared for ulcers.

# Emergency Department Care and Disposition

Elder abuse is widely underreported and underrecognized. Treatment entails three key components:

Medical  problems  and  injuries  may  be  best  managed  with  hospital admission. If neglect is unintentional, educate the caregiver. All 50 states have reporting requirements for elder abuse and neglect. Requirements for reporting within one's practice area are available at www.nceaaoa.gov.

Not all individuals who are sexually assaulted sustain an injury. Lack of injury does not mean that an assault did not occur. Often the perpetrator is known to the assault survivor.

Intimate partner violence and abuse is defined as a pattern of assaultive behavior that  may include physical injury, sexual assault,  psychological abuse,  stalking,  deprivation,  intimidation,  and  threats.  Intimate  partner violence  and  abuse  occurs  in  every  race,  ethnicity,  culture,  geographic region, and religious affiliation and occurs in gay, lesbian, and heterosexual relationships.

# ■ CLINICAL FEATURES

Elements of the sexual assault history are listed in Table 188-1. The history  for  intimate  partner  violence  and  abuse  can  be  more  difficult  to obtain.  Risk  factors  for  intimate  partner  violence  and  abuse  include female  sex,  age  between  18  and  24  years,  low  socioeconomic  status,

separated relationship  status,  and  residence  in  rental  housing.  Injuries inconsistent with the patient's history, multiple injuries in various stages of  healing,  delay  in  the  time  of  injury  occurrence  and  presentation,  a visit  for  vague  complaints  without  evidence  of  injury,  or  suicide attempts  should  trigger  suspicions  of  intimate  partner  violence  and abuse. Patients may complain initially of chronic pain syndromes, gynecologic or psychiatric difficulties, and alcohol and substance abuse. The patient  also  may  appear  frightened  when  the  partner  is  present  or  the partner  may  be  hostile,  defensive,  aggressive,  or  overly  solicitous. Recent and remote abuse, including dates, locations, details  of  abuse, and witnesses, should be documented. Patients need to be asked about any suicidal or homicidal ideation and plans and get appropriate, immediate evaluation.

Perform a general medical examination including vital signs, appearance and demeanor. Focus head-to-toe inspection on defensive injury areas, such as  the  extremities,  and  potential  areas  of  injury,  such  as  the  oral  cavity, breasts, thighs, and buttocks. Record all the signs of trauma, new and old, in detail using a body map. Speculum examination should note any trauma, discharge,  abrasions,  including  on  the  cervix.  If  anal  penetration  is reported, the rectum should be examined for abrasions and lacerations. Use of anoscopy in male patients increases detection of trauma.

Characteristic  injuries  of  intimate  partner  violence  and  abuse  include fingernail scratches, bite marks, cigarette burns, rope burns, and forearm bruising or nightstick fractures, suggesting a defensive posture. Abdominal injuries are common in the pregnant intimate partner violence and abuse patient (Table 188-2).

# evidence examination

Evidence collection in sexual assault is performed only within the first 72 hours after the assault. Informed consent is required. Most hospitals have a prepackaged rape kit. Chain of custody of the evidence must be maintained and the kit should never be left unattended. Not every part of the forensic evidence kit needs to be used every time. Tailor the evidence collection  to  the  specifics  of  the  assault,  if  known.  If > 72  hours  have elapsed or the patient declines an evidentiary examination, perform a history and physical examination, document injuries, and provide prophylaxis for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Label evidence clearly  with  the  patient's  name,  type  and  source  of  evidence,  date  and time, and name of the examiner collecting the evidence. If there is high suspicion of drug-facilitated rape, a urine sample can be sent to a laboratory for toxicologic testing.

# ■ DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL

Sexual assault is a legal determination, not a medical diagnosis. The legal definition  contains  three  elements:  carnal  knowledge,  nonconsent,  and compulsion or fear of harm. Because of the legal considerations, careful documentation and evidence collection are important.

Many experts  recommend routine  screening  for  intimate  partner  violence and abuse for all adolescent and adult women who present to the ED and  for  mothers  of  children.  Providers  educated  about  the  dynamics  of intimate partner violence and abuse should conduct screening in a safe and private  environment.  Document  all  the  findings,  interventions,  referrals, and required reporting.

# ■ EMERGENCY DEpARTMENT CARE AND DISpOSITION

Address  life-threatening  injuries  and  the  psychological  needs.  Treating critical injuries are the initial priority of the ED physician. A social worker or trained advocate should counsel the patient in the ED. Ensure the safety of the patient and any children involved while they are in the ED. Be familiar with reporting laws in your state.

# STD Prophylaxis

Recommended regimens for infection prophylaxis include a single dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg IM OR single dose of cefixime 400 mg PO PLUS a single dose of metronidazole 2 g PO PLUS a single dose of azithromycin 1 g PO, OR doxycycline 100 mg PO twice a day for 7 days.

# STD Treatment

# Hepatitis Prophylaxis

Administer vaccine at the time of initial exam if patient has not been previously vaccinated. Follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1 to 2 months and 4 to 6 months after the first dose

# HIV: Prophylaxis and Counseling

Rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion are low but occur from sexual assault or sexual abuse. Circumstances should guide the decision to administer postexposure prophylaxis. An assailant known to be infected with HIV, high viral load exposure, vaginal trauma, and ejaculate on membranes increase the risk for HIV seroconversion. Post-HIV exposure recommendations are posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (www.cdc.gov). Additional assistance may be obtained by calling the 24-hour National HIV/AIDS Post Exposure Hotline at 1-888-448-4911. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended, and counseling and follow-up should be provided.

# Special Situations

The goal of palliative care is to relieve suffering of patients and families who live with serious illness. It is imperative to ascertain goals of care while  concurrently  stabilizing  or  temporizing  the  patient  clinically  and treating symptoms. We need to then compassionately communicate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment alternatives and guide the formulation of a therapeutic plan.

# ■ IDENTIFYING PATIENTS FOR PALLIATIVE CARE

It is important to recognize when patients have unmet palliative needs and have a rapid palliative approach to these patients. See Table 189-1. Patient and family expectations can be managed by expert formulation and communication of prognosis. Prognosis will also guide treatment options. The most  important  factor  in  formulating  a  prognosis  is  functional  ability. Generally, components of functional status which herald a poor prognosis and may indicate that the patient is on the dying trajectory are loss of the ability to care for oneself, unintentional weight loss, inability to ambulate, inability to maintain oral intake, and declining level of consciousness.

# Table 189-2

# Key Communication Phrases

# Determining Decision-Making Capacity

Will you describe your current condition?

Tell me about the treatment options we have just discussed. Explain to me why you feel that way.

# Quality of life

What symptoms bother you the most? What concerns you the most?

# Prognosis

Has anyone talked to you about what to expect?

Do you have any sense of how much time is left? Is this something you would like to talk about?

# Talking with Surrogate Decision Makers

These decisions are very hard; if [the patient] was sitting with us today, what do you think [he/she] would say?

Can you tell me why you feel that way?

It is not a question of whether we will care for your [loved one], but how we will care for them. Then we will do everything possible to keep your [loved one] comfortable, but we won't be providing ineffective and burdensome therapies such as CPR or intubation.

# Discussing Palliative Care or Hospice Referral

To meet the goals we've discussed, I've asked the palliative care team to visit with you; they are experts in treating the symptoms you are experiencing. They can help your family deal with the changes brought on by your illness.

# breaking bad News-Death Pronouncement

I wish there is more we could have done, your loved one has died; I'm very sorry for your loss. This has to be really difficult for you. Is there anyone I can call to be with you now?

# ■ SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT

# Pain

# Introduction

Any validated pain scale can be used to assess pain and track response to treatment. Remember to evaluate as you would for any pain complaint: location,  character,  duration,  quality,  alleviating/exacerbating  factors.  Asking what pain level is tolerable to them and their baseline pain score can be helpful. Do not judge malignant pain based on outward appearance or vital signs.

To begin to treat the pain, first find out if the patient is opiate naïve or opiate  tolerant.  If  patient  is  opiate  naïve,  the  starting  dose  of morphine is

--- Page 1044 ---

1024 SECTION 23: Special Situations

0.1 mg/kg IV. For opiate tolerant patients, consider starting with hydromorphone 1  or  2  mg  IV .  Opiates reach maximum therapeutic levels and  have  peak  effects/side  effects  at  6  to  10  minutes.  Therefore,  IV  pain medications can be safely re-dosed every 15 minutes until relief is reached. The biggest obstacle to aggressive pain management with opiates is the fear of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression is not a sudden occurrence, but instead is part of a progression that starts with sedation, somnolence, and finally respiratory depression. A patient can be safely dosed and re-dosed until the symptoms are palliated, as long as level of consciousness is monitored.

# Dyspnea

While identifying the cause of dyspnea and treating the underlying pathology, treatment should also be offered to palliate the symptoms. Opioids are  extremely  beneficial  in  treating  the  agitation  and  anxiety  provoked by dyspnea. For an opioid-naïve patient, start with a dose of morphine 0.05  mg/kg  IV  (half  the  starting  dose  used  for  pain),  and  monitor  for sedation and hypoventilation. Use a goal of maintaining a respiratory rate of at least 10 to 12 breaths per minute

# Nausea/Vomiting

The underlying cause of nausea can help identify the class of antiemetic drugs  most  likely  to  be  therapeutic.  For  chemotherapy-induced  nausea, high doses of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists such as ondansetron 8 mg IVP or corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 10 mg IVP are helpful. Steroids can improve symptoms caused by increased intracranial pressure and bowel obstruction from cancer. For refractory nausea, try a dopamine  antagonist  such  as haloperidol 0.5  to  4  mg  IVP. Metoclopramide 10 mg in 100 mL NS IV is excellent for the symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis  or  compression  of  the  stomach  due  to  tumor  or  ascites,  or small bowel obstruction, as it increases motility.

# agitation/Delirium

Patients with terminal illness may become agitated, with or without delirium. The causes of this agitation are multifactorial, including pain, anxiety, terminal restlessness, breathlessness, fecal impaction, and mental anguish. The indicated class of medications varies depending on the situation but includes antipsychotics such as haloperidol 1 to 5 mg IV, anxiolytics such as midazolam 1  to  4  mg  IV ,  and  opiates  such  as morphine 2  to  10  mg IV.There is no evidence that these palliative interventions hasten death.

# Constipation

Constipation is a universal side effect for patients on opiates. These patients need a concurrent 2-drug bowel regimen, including an osmotic agent, such as lactulose 30  mL every 24 hours or propylene glycol 17  g  powder in 8 oz of water every 24 hours, along with a stimulant laxative, such as senna 2 tabs every evening or bisacodyl 5 to 15 mg × 1 dose.
