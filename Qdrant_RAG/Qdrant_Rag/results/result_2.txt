Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants the three most likely differential diagnoses for a 45-year-old woman with sudden shortness of breath, right-sided pleuritic chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, no fever or purulent sputum, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, calf swelling, and tenderness. The context provided has ten sources, so I need to go through each one to find relevant info.

First, the key symptoms: sudden SOB, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, calf swelling. These point towards possible pulmonary embolism (PE) because of the DVT risk after orthopedic surgery. Source 1 mentions that unilateral effusions can be due to PE, and Source 4 talks about shock in MI, but the patient's history of surgery makes PE more likely. Also, Source 6 mentions pulmonary laceration from trauma, but the patient's surgery was two weeks ago, not a recent trauma. Source 8 discusses pneumonia, but no fever or sputum, and the chest exam is normal. However, Source 8 says that in older patients, pneumonia can present atypically, but the patient is 45, not elderly. But the absence of fever and the presence of DVT risk factors make PE more likely.

Another possibility is myocardial infarction (MI). Source 4 mentions that CS can occur in MI, but the patient's symptoms are more acute. However, the patient has no chest pain described as crushing, just pleuritic. Also, the history of surgery might not directly relate to MI. But Source 4 says that shock can present with tachycardia and hypotension. However, the absence of typical MI symptoms like chest pressure might make this less likely. Also, the calf swelling suggests DVT, which is a risk factor for PE, not MI.

Third, maybe a pulmonary infection like pneumonia. But the patient has no fever, no sputum, and lung sounds are normal. Source 8 says that pneumonia can present without classic symptoms, but the presence of DVT risk factors and the sudden onset make PE more likely. Also, Source 1 mentions that bilateral effusions are typical of CHF, but the patient has unilateral? Wait, the patient's chest pain is right-sided, but the context says unilateral effusions raise PE. However, the patient's chest exam is normal, so maybe no effusion. But the context doesn't mention effusions in the case, so maybe that's not directly relevant. 

Another possibility is aortic dissection, but there's no mention of that in the context. The context doesn't have info on aortic dissection, so maybe not. 

So the three differentials would be PE, MI, and maybe pulmonary embolism, but also considering other options. Wait, the user wants three. Let me check the sources again.

Source 1: Unilateral effusions suggest PE, but the case doesn't mention effusions. However, the patient has DVT risk factors. Source 4 mentions that shock in MI can present with tachycardia and hypotension. Source 8 talks about pneumonia but the absence of fever and sputum makes it less likely. 

So the three differentials would be:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: Key findings are recent orthopedic surgery (DVT risk), calf swelling, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia. The context in Source 1 mentions that unilateral effusions can be PE, but the case doesn't have effusions. However, the presence of DVT risk factors and symptoms support PE. Features against: no mention of effusions, but that's not a direct contradiction.

2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has tachycardia, hypotension, and chest pain. Source 4 mentions CS in MI, but the patient's chest pain is pleuritic, not typical MI chest pain. Also, no mention of ECG changes or other MI markers. Features against: lack of typical MI symptoms like chest pressure, and no history of CAD.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has SOB, but no fever or sputum. Source 8 says atypical presentation in older patients, but the patient is 45. However, the context says that pneumonia requires a new opacity on chest X-ray. Since the case doesn't mention imaging, but the context says that chest X-ray is used for pneumonia. However, the absence of lung findings (normal lung sounds) might argue against pneumonia. Features against: normal lung sounds and no fever.

Wait, but the user wants three. Maybe the third is a different one. Alternatively, maybe acute pulmonary edema? But the patient has no history of heart failure, and the context mentions bilateral effusions in CHF (Source 1), but the patient's symptoms are more acute. However, the patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be from cardiogenic shock, but that's more MI. 

Alternatively, maybe a hemothorax or pneumothorax, but the context doesn't mention those. The sources mention pulmonary laceration in Source 6, but that's from trauma, which the patient doesn't have. 

So the three differentials are PE, MI, and pneumonia. But need to check the context for each.

For PE: Source 1 mentions that unilateral effusions raise PE, but the case doesn't have that. However, the patient's DVT risk factors and symptoms support PE. 

For MI: Source 4 mentions that shock can occur, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with PE. 

For pneumonia: Source 8 says that atypical presentation can happen, but the absence of fever and lung findings makes it less likely. 

So the answer would be:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: Key findings - recent surgery, DVT risk, calf swelling, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia. Features against: no mention of effusions, but that's not in the case.

2. Myocardial Infarction: Key findings - tachycardia, hypotension, chest pain. Features against: atypical chest pain, no ECG info.

3. Pneumonia: Key findings - SOB, but features against: no fever, normal lung exam, no sputum.

Source 1 (Page 923, Section: ):
An enlarged cardiac silhouette can point toward dilated cardiomyopathy or valvular disease. Bilateral pleural effusions are typical of CHF and some forms of collagen-vascular disease. Unilateral effusions raise the specter of carcinoma and pulmonary embolism but may also occur in heart failure or in the case of a parapneumonic effusion. CT of the chest is generally reserved for further evaluation of the lung parenchyma (interstitial lung disease) and possible pulmonary embolism if there remains diagnostic uncertainty.

Source 2 (Page 142, Section: DIAGNOSIS):
# DIAGNOSIS

The clinical diagnosis of a respiratory syndrome and the anatomic location of infection are based on history, physical examination, and radiography. A specific viral etiology can be determined by specific diagnostic tests. The gold standard for diagnosing a respiratory viral infection is virus isolation, performed by inoculation of cell cultures with fresh secretions and use of multiple cell types in a reference laboratory staffed by experienced technologists. Direct or indirect fluorescent antibody detection can be used to visualize virus-infected cells in nasal secretions. Rapid antigen-based diagnostic tests are used to detect influenza virus or RSV proteins in nasopharyngeal secretions. The most sensitive tests typically are RT-PCR molecular diagnostic tests that amplify and detect the presence of viral genomic RNA or DNA in respiratory secretions. Multiplex panels assaying a sample for a dozen or more common respiratory viruses are available. These tests must be used and interpreted carefully because of their extreme sensitivity. If care is not taken, it is relatively easy to contaminate a PCR test in the laboratory with small amounts of DNA from a previous reaction. In addition, because a viral genome can sometimes persist in nasal secretions for weeks after an infection resolves, a positive test may indicate a recently resolved rather than a currently acute infection. Despite these limitations, PCR tests generally are considered the most sensitive and specific tests available. Chest radiographs should be obtained for all patients with suspected pneumonia.

Source 3 (Page 3340, Section: Monitoring):
# Monitoring

Monitoring assists in the ongoing management of all patients. The key monitoring of the ventilated child is for comfortable ventilation, including oxygenation and WOB. Deterioration in WOB mandates immediate attention to consider the status of the underlying condition and the possible development of a complication, such as a poor mask fit, obstructed or dislodged ET, or ventilator equipment failure. In the sedated and paralyzed patient pulse oximetry, endtidal carbon dioxide and blood gas analysis are especially important. Chest roentgenography may help to determine the ET position, the evidence of air leak, and the development of new infiltrates, in addition to monitoring the baseline condition for which MV was instituted.

Source 4 (Page 409, Section: ):
Patient Profile In patients with MI, older age, prior MI, diabetes mellitus, anterior MI location, and multivessel coronary artery disease with extensive coronary artery stenoses are associated with an increased risk of CS. Shock associated with a first inferior MI should prompt a search for a mechanical cause or RV involvement. CS may rarely occur in the absence of significant stenosis, as seen in takotsubo syndrome or fulminant myocarditis.

Timing Shock is present on admission in approximately one-quarter of MI patients who develop CS; of these patients, one-quarter develop it rapidly thereafter, within 6 h of MI onset, and another quarter develop shock later on the first day. Later onset of CS may be due to reinfarction, marked infarct expansion, or mechanical complications.

Diagnosis For these unstable patients, supportive therapy must be initiated simultaneously with diagnostic evaluation (Fig. 305-3) . A focused history and physical examination should be performed along with an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, lactate measurement, and blood specimens for laboratory analysis. Initial echocardiography is an invaluable tool to elucidate the underlying cause of CS.

Source 7 (Page 233, Section: ):
Most patients will present with dyspnea and/or fatigue, whereas edema, chest pain, presyncope, and syncope are less common and associated with more advanced disease. In early phases of PAH, the physical examination is often unrevealing. As the disease progresses, there may be evidence of right ventricular failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites. Additionally, the cardiovascular examination may reveal an accentuated P 2  component of the second heart sound, a right-sided S 3 or S 4 , and a holosystolic tricuspid regurgitant murmur. It is also important to seek signs of the diseases that are commonly concurrent with PH: clubbing may be seen in some chronic lung diseases, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia may signify scleroderma (or the limited cutaneous form, CREST [calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia]), and crackles on examination of the lungs and systemic hypertension may be clues to left-sided systolic or diastolic heart failure.

Overview of the Diagnostic Clinical Evaluation Once clinical suspicion is raised, a systematic approach to diagnosis and assessment is essential. In advanced disease, electrocardiography may show right ventricular hypertrophy or strain, and enlargement of pulmonary arteries and obliteration of the retrosternal space is often observed on chest roentgenography (Fig. 283-4) . In turn, echocardiography with agitated saline (bubble) study is the most important initial screening test. Elevated estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (>35 mmHg) or a hypertrophied or dilated right ventricle support the diagnosis of PH. Important additional information can be gleaned about specific etiologies of PH, such as valvular disease, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, left atrial enlargement, and intracardiac shunt.

should be examined in these patients despite lack of classic signs and symptoms.

In older patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities,  pneumonia  may  present  with  general  weakness, decreased appetite, altered mental status, incontinence, or decompensation due to underlying disease. The presence of tachypnea may precede other signs of pneumonia by 1 to 2 days. Tachycardia is another common initial sign but is less frequent and specific than tachypnea. Fever is absent in 30-40% of older patients. Owing to the lack of specific symptoms,  the  diagnosis  of  CAP  is  frequently  delayed  in older adults. 36,61  Older patients with pneumonia who present  with  altered  mental  status  without  fever  can  have  a delay  in  receiving  antibiotics  by  more  than  4  hours  after arrival, a delay that increases mortality. 99

Occasionally, there is a 'classic' history, such as that of the patient with pneumococcal infection who presents with sudden onset of rigor followed by pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea,  and  cough  with  rusty  sputum.  Similarly,  a  patient with Legionella pneumonia may complain predominantly of diarrhea, fever, headache, confusion, and myalgia. For M. pneumoniae infection, extrapulmonary manifestations such as  myringitis,  encephalitis,  uveitis,  iritis,  and  myocarditis may be present. However, only rarely does the clinical history clearly suggest a specific etiology.

The clinical and radiographic features of sporadic cases of viral pneumonia are usually not sufficiently characteristic to permit specific viral diagnosis or differentiation from bacterial pneumonias on clinical grounds alone. Exceptions include  measles  (eFig.  46.1)  and  varicella  pneumonia,  in which the associated rash establishes the diagnosis. Some cases of viral pneumonia present as severe CAP and have a rapid and relentless fatal course, with generalized alveolar and interstitial  opacities,  development  of  ARDS,  and  progressive respiratory failure.

Information obtained from the clinical history and physical examination is insufficient to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. A definitive diagnosis requires the finding of a new opacity on the chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT) scan.

Once the child is stable and safe, a lateral neck radiograph with the neck in full extension may confirm the diagnosis. Widened prevertebral soft-tissue shadow and air-fluid levels in the retropharyngeal space are all indicators. 6  The radiograph must be taken in the correct position (true lateral orientation, with the neck in extension, and if possible, during full inspiration) to ensure that the retropharyngeal space is not falsely thickened. 84 A contrastenhanced computed tomography scan is useful because it differentiates a fully developed abscess from cellulitis and delineates the full extent of the abscess. Blood cultures findings are usually negative, but the white blood cell count will be increased.

advantages of lack of radiation, ease of interpretation, potential for portability and rapid results. However, this requires significant performer training. CT is another option that is available in some settings. It provides high definition of the lung parenchyma and mediastinal structures, which is useful if the chest x-ray findings require further delineation, such as determining if a density is due to prominent vasculature or lymphadenopathy. However, CT uses a significant amount of radiation, requires intravenous contrast and is costly. These issues limit CT use in low-resource settings.
